## Navigating this Lesson

There is about # hour and ## minutes of lecture.  If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional TIME.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail.  All original materials are provided at the [Github site](https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_CPA) that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's [introduction](#ReCintro)

### Learning Objectives

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

* one
* two
* three
  * three.1
  * three.2
  * three.3

### Planning for Practice

The suggestions for homework are graded in complexity ... The more complete descriptions at the end of the chapter follow these suggestions.

* Rework the problem in the chapter by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data.  This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar. SINCE I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT CHANGING THE RANDOM SEED DOES MUCH, I MAY CHANGE THIS ONE TO AN EXAMPLE I WORK WITH ANSWERS AT THE END.
* There are a number of variables in the dataset.  Swap out one or more variables in the NAME THE STATISTIC and compare your solution to the one in the chapter (and/or oNe you mimicked in the journal article).
* Conduct a NAME THE STATISTIC with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article.

### Readings & Resources

In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s). Other resources are cited (when possible, linked) in the text with complete citations in the reference list.

* TEXT
* WEB SOURCES
* JOURNAL ARTICLE VIGNETTE

### Simulating the data from the journal article


### Quick peek at the data

Descriptives
R matrix
Consider pairpanels
Consider the M, SD, r matrix from apaTables


## Working the NAME OF STATISTIC

Method/Analytic Strategy APA style description of the hypotheses and how they will be analyzed.

![relevant conceptual or statistical figure of the planned analysis](images/subfolder/filename.jpg)

Relevant formulas

$$M = i_{M}+a_{1}X + a_{2}W + a_{3}XW + e_{M}$$

$$Y = i_{Y}+c_{1}^{'}X+ c_{2}^{'}W+c_{3}^{'}XW+ bM+e_{Y}$$

### Analysis

If possible, work in smaller sections.  Provide APA style results after each meaningful chunk (that will be assembled into the formal results, later).


```{r Placeholder to write objects to an outfile}
#write.csv (objectname, file="filename.csv") #optional to write it to a .csv file
```

```{r Placeholder to create model object names, echo = FALSE, results ='hide'}
library(formattable) #to use the digits function
# Values for the intercept of the IV
#Yicpt <- digits(cParamEsts$est[9], 3) #B weight for the intercept
##Yicpt 
#Yicpt_SE <- digits(cParamEsts$se[9], 3)#p value for the intercept
#Yicpt_SE
#Yicpt_p <- digits(cParamEsts$pvalue[9], 3)#p value for the intercept
#Yicpt_p

# Proportion of variance accounted for
#Rsq_Y <- percent(cFITsum$PE$est[30])
#Rsq_Y
#Rsq_M <- percent(cFITsum$PE$est[29])
#Rsq_M
```

### Beginning the interpretation

Placeholder for formula

$$\hat{M} = i_{M}+a_{1}X + a_{2}W + a_{3}XW + e_{M}$$


$$\hat{Y} = i_{Y}+c_{1}^{'}X+ c_{2}^{'}W+c_{3}^{'}XW+ bM+e_{Y}$$

And substitute in our values

$$\hat{M} = 1.417 + 0.212X + (-0.027) W + 0.006XW$$
$$\hat{Y} = 31.703 + (-1.4115)X + (-0.556)W + 0.164XW + (-3.567)M$$

..that you might have; or at least I had, but if had answered them earlier it would have disrupt the flow.

   
## Practice Problems

The suggested practice problem for this chapter is to conduct a simple mediation.


### Problem #1: Rework the research vignette as demonstrated, but change the random seed

If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation, then rework the problem. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar.

### Problem #3:  Use other data that is available to you

Using data for which you have permission and access (e.g.,  IRB approved data you have collected or from your lab; data you simulate from a published article; data from an open science repository; data from other chapters in this OER), complete a simple mediation.
