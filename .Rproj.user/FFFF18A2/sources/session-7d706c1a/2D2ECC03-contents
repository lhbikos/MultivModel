For more information about the data used in this homeworked example, please refer to the description and codebook located at the end of the [introductory lesson](https://lhbikos.github.io/ReCenterPsychStats/ReCintro.html#introduction-to-the-data-set-used-for-homeworked-examples) in [ReCentering Psych Stats](https://lhbikos.github.io/ReCenterPsychStats/). An .rds file which holds the data is located in the [Worked Examples](https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivModel/tree/main/Worked_Examples) folder at the GitHub site the hosts the OER. The file name is *ReC.rds*.

The suggested practice problem for this chapter is to conduct a complex (i.e., parallel or serial) mediation. 

### Assign each variable to the X, Y, M1, and M2 roles {-}

X = Centering: explicit recentering (0 = precentered; 1 = recentered)
M1 = TradPed: traditional pedagogy (continuously scaled with higher scores being more favorable)
M2 = SRPed:  socially responsive pedagogy (continuously scaled with higher scores being more favorable)
Y = Valued: valued by me (continuously scaled with higher scores being more favorable)

In this *parallel mediation*, I am hypothesizing that the perceived course value to the students is predicted by intentional recentering through their assessments of traditional and socially responsive pedagogy.

It helps me to make a quick sketch:

![An image of the parallel mediation model for the homeworked example.](Worked_Examples/images/CompMedHWfig.jpg)

### Import the data and format the variables in the model  {-}

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
raw <- readRDS("ReC.rds")
```

The approach we are taking to complex mediation does not allow dependency in the data. Therefore, we will include only those who took the multivariate class (i.e., excluding responses for the ANOVA and psychometrics courses).
```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
raw <-(dplyr::filter(raw, Course == "Multivariate"))
```

I need to score the TradPed, SRPed, and Valued variables

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
TradPed_vars <- c('ClearResponsibilities', 'EffectiveAnswers','Feedback', 'ClearOrganization','ClearPresentation')  
raw$TradPed <- sjstats::mean_n(raw[, ..TradPed_vars], .75)

Valued_vars <- c('ValObjectives', 'IncrUnderstanding','IncrInterest')  
raw$Valued <- sjstats::mean_n(raw[, ..Valued_vars], .75)

SRPed_vars <- c('InclusvClassrm','EquitableEval', 'MultPerspectives', 'DEIintegration')  
raw$SRPed <- sjstats::mean_n(raw[,..SRPed_vars], .75)
```

I will create a babydf.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
babydf <- dplyr::select(raw, Centering, TradPed, Valued, SRPed)
```

Let's check the structure of the variables:

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
str(babydf)
```

At this point, these my only inclusion/exclusion criteria. I can determine how many students (who consented) completed any portion of the survey.

### Specify and run the lavaan model  {-}

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
ReCpMed <- '
          Valued ~ b1*TradPed + b2*SRPed + c_p*Centering
          TradPed ~ a1*Centering
          SRPed ~ a2*Centering
          
          indirect1 := a1 * b1
          indirect2 := a2 * b2
          contrast := indirect1 - indirect2
          total_indirects := indirect1 + indirect2
          total_c    := c_p + (indirect1) + (indirect2)
          direct := c_p
          '
ReCpMedfit <- lavaan::sem(ReCpMed, data = babydf, se="bootstrap", missing= 'fiml')
ReCpMedsummary <- lavaan::summary(ReCpMedfit, standardized=T, rsq=T, fit=TRUE, ci=TRUE)
ReC_pMedParamEsts <- lavaan::parameterEstimates(ReCpMedfit, boot.ci.type = "bca.simple", standardized=TRUE)
ReCpMedsummary
ReC_pMedParamEsts
```

### Use tidySEM to create a figure that represents your results {-}


```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
#only worked when I used the library to turn on all these pkgs
library(lavaan)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidySEM)
tidySEM::graph_sem(model=ReCpMedfit)
```


```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
tidySEM::get_layout(ReCpMedfit)
```
To create the figure I showed at the beginning of the chapter, we will want three rows and three columns.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
ReCpMed_map <- tidySEM::get_layout("", "TradPed", "",
                                   "Centering", "", "Valued", 
                                   "", "SRPed", "", rows=3)
ReCpMed_map
```
```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
tidySEM::graph_sem(ReCpMedfit, layout=ReCpMed_map,  rect_width = 1.5, rect_height = 1.25, spacing_x = 2, spacing_y = 3, text_size = 4.5)
```



### Create a table that includes a summary of the effects (indirect, direct, total, total indirect) as well as contrasts {-}

I will write my results to a .csv file.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
write.csv(ReC_pMedParamEsts, file = "ReC_pMedParamEsts.csv")
```

### Represent your work in an APA-style write-up {-}

A model of parallel mediation analyzed the degree to which students' perceptions of traditional and socially responsive pedagogy mediated the relationship between explicit recentering of the course and course value. Hayes [-@hayes_more_2022] recommended this strategy over simple mediation models because it allows for all mediators to be examined, simultaneously.  The resultant direct and indirect values for each path account for other mediation paths.  Using the *lavaan* (v. 0.6-16) package in R, coefficients for specific indirect, total indirect, direct, and total were computed.  Path coefficients refer to regression weights, or slopes, of the expected changes in the dependent variable given a unit change in the independent variables.  

Results (depicted in Figure 1 and presented in Table 1) suggest that 58% of the variance in perceptions of course value is accounted for by the model. The indirect effect predicting course value from explicit recentering through traditional pedagogy was statistically significant $(B = 0.214, SE = 0.103, p = 0.037, 95CI [0.035, 0.440])$. Examining the individual paths we see that $a_{1}$ was positive and statistically significant (recentering is associated with higher evaluations of traditional pedagogy). The  $b_{1}$ path was similarly statistically significant (traditional pedagogy was associated with course valuation). The indirect effect predicting course value from recentering through socially responsive pedagogy was not statistically significant $B = 0.042, SE = 0.053, p = 0.429, 95CE [-0.040, 0.184])$.  While explicit recentering had a statistically significant effect on ratings of socially responsive pedagogy (i.e., the $a_{2}$ path), socially responsive pedagogy did not have a statistically significant effect on perceptions of course value (i.e., the $b_{2}$ path). The drop in magnitude and near-significance from the total effect $(B = 0.271, p = 0.059)$ to the direct effect $(B = 0.015, p = 0.885)$ supports the presence of mediation.  A pairwise comparison of the specific indirect effects indicated that the strength of the effects were not statistically significantly different from each other. In summary, the effects of explicit recentering on perceived value to the student appears to be mediated through students evaluation of traditional pedagogy.


### Explanation to grader {-}

### Be able to hand-calculate the indirect, direct, and total effects from the a, b, & c' paths {-}

* Indirect = a*b
* Direct = Total minus indirect
* Total = (a*b) + c'

### A homework idea {-}

Augment this model to a serial mediation -- adding a path from traditional pedagogy to socially responsive pedagogy.
