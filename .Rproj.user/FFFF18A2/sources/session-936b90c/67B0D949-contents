The focus of this lecture is the moderated mediation.  That is, are the effects of the indirect effect (sign, significance, strength, presence/absence) *conditional* on the effects of the moderator.

At the outset, please note that although I rely heavily on Hayes [-@hayes_introduction_2022] text and materials, I am using the R package *lavaan* in these chapters.  Recently, Hayes has introduced a [PROCESS macro for R](https://www.processmacro.org/index.html). Because I am not yet up-to-speed on using this macro (it is not a typical R package) and because we will use *lavaan* for confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, I have chosen to utilize the *lavaan* package.  A substantial difference is that the PROCESS macros use ordinary least squares and *lavaan* uses maximum likelihood estimators.

## Navigating this Lesson

There is about 1 hour and 15 minutes of lecture.  If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional hour and a half.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail.  All original materials are provided at the [Github site](https://https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_MultivModel) that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's [introduction](#ReCintro)

### Learning Objectives

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

* Outline a process of evaluating a moderated mediation in a piecewise [@hayes_introduction_2022]  approach to model building
* Recognize conditional process modeling from R script.
* Using the R package *lavaan*, 
  - specify a model with indirect effects,
  - identify and interpret B weights, *p* values, and *CIs* for total, direct, and indirect effects,   
  - calculate the total effects of X and M on Y, 
  - identify the proportion of variance accounted for in predicting M and Y.
* Regarding conditional indirect effects
  - Interpret an index of moderated mediation
  - Know the essential components of calculating an index of moderated mediation
  - Probe a conditional indirect effect
* Interpret "the usual" things we find in regression:  B/beta weights, R, $R^{2}$, and figures

### Planning for Practice

The suggestions for homework are graded in complexity and, if you like, can extend from the prior chapter on simple moderation. If you choose the first or second options, you can further amend the simulated data by making further variations such as sample size.

* Rework the problem in the chapter by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data.  This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar.
* There are a number of variables in the dataset.  Swap out one or more variables in the moderated mediation and compare your solution to the one in the chapter (and/or oe you mimicked in the journal article).
* Conduct a moderated mediation with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article.

## Conditional Process Analysis

### The definitional and conceptual

Hayes [@hayes_introduction_2022] coined the term and suggests we also talk about "conditional process modeling."

**Conditional process analysis**:  used when the analytical goal is to describe and understand the conditional nature of the mechanism or mechanisms by which a variable transmits its effect on another.

We are integrating moderation and mediation mechanisms together into a single integrated analytical model. 

* **Mediator**: Any causal system in which at least one causal antecedent X variable is proposed as influencing an outcome Y through a intervening variable M.  In this model, there are two pathways by which X can influence Y:  *direct* effect of X on Y, and *indirect* effect of X on Y through M. 
  * Answers question, "How does X affect Y"
  * Partitions the X-to-Y relationship into two paths of influence: direct, indirect.
  * Indirect effect contains two components (a,b) that when multipled (a*b) yield an estimate of how much these two cases that differ by one unit on X are estimated to differ on Y through the effect of X on M, which in turn affects Y.
  * Keywords: how, through, via, indirect effect
* **Moderator**:  The effect of X on some variable Y is moderated by W if its size, sign, or strength depends on or can be predicted by W.
  * Stated another way, W and X *interact* in their influence on Y.  
  * Moderators help establish the boundary conditions of an effect or the circumstances, stimuli, or type of people for which the effect is large v. small, present v. absent, positive v. negative, and so forth.
  * Keywords:  "it depends," interaction effect.

**Why should we engage both mediators and moderators?**  Hayes [-@hayes_introduction_2022] suggest that if we have only a mediator(s) in the model that we lose information if we "reduce complex responses that no doubt differ from person to person or situation to situation" (p. 394).  He adds that "all effects are moderated by something" (p. 394). Correspondingly, he recommends we add them to a mediation anlaysis.

Hayes [-@hayes_introduction_2022] suggests that "more complete" (p. 395) analyses model the mechanisms at work linking X to Y (mediator[s]) while simultaneously allowing those effects to be contingent on context, circumstance, or individual difference (moderator[s]).

**What are conditional direct and indirect effects?**.  Mediation analyses produce indirect (the product of a sequence of effects that are assumed to be causal) and direct (the unique contribution of X to Y, controlling for other variables in the model) effects.  These effects (the X-to-Y/direct and X-to-M-to-Y/indirect), can also be moderated.  This is our quest! Figure 11.2 in Hayes' text [-@hayes_introduction_2022] illustrates conceptually and statistically that we can specify moderation of any combination of direct and indirect paths/effects.

![Image of conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a path; the path between the IV and mediator](images/SimpleMed/CPAmodel.jpg)

Within the CPA framework we have lots of options that generally fall into two categories:

* *Moderated mediation*:  when an indirect effect of X on Y through M is moderated; the mechanism represented by the *X-to-M-to-Y* chain of events operates to varying degrees (or not at all) for certain people or in certain contexts. 
  * Any model in which the indirect effect (a*b) changes as a function of one or more moderators.  These moderators can be operating on the a, b, or c' paths or any possible combination of the three
  * X could moderate its own indirect effect on Y through M if the effect of M on Y depends on X, or
  * The indirect effect of X on Y through M could be contingent on a fourth variable if that fourth variable W moderates one or more of the relationships in a three-variable causal system, or
  * An indirect effect could be contingent on a moderator variable

* *Mediated moderation*:  an interaction between X and some moderator W on Y is carried through a mediator M; 
  * mediated moderation analysis is simply a mediation analysis with the product of two variables serving as the causal agent of focus
  * An interaction between a moderator W and causal agent X on outcome Y could operate through a mediator M

Hayes argues that the mediated moderation hypotheses are "regularly articulated and tested by scientists" [-@hayes_introduction_2022, p. 459].  He warns, though, that we should not confuse the "abundance of published examples of mediated moderation analyses...with the meaningfulness of the procedure itself" (p. 460).  He later adds that mediation moderation is "neither interesting nor meaningful."  Why?  

*  Conceptualizing a process in terms of a mediated moderation misdirects attention toward a variable in the model that actually doesn't measure anything.
*   Most often there are moderated mediation models that are identical in equations and resulting coefficients - the difference is in the resulting attentional focus and interpretation.
*   Hayes [-@hayes_introduction_2022] recommends that models proposing mediated moderation be recast in terms of moderated mediation process.
*   Consequently, we will not work a mediated moderation, but there is an example in his text.

## Workflow for Moderated Mediation

![A colorful image of a workflow for complex mediation](images/ModMed/Workflow_ModMed.jpg) 
Conducting a moderated mediation involves the following steps:

1. Conducting an a priori power analysis to determine the appropriate sample size.
   + This will require estimates of effect that are drawn from pilot data, the literature, or both.
2. [Scrubbing](https://lhbikos.github.io/ReC_MultivModel/scrub.html) and [scoring](https://lhbikos.github.io/ReC_MultivModel/score.html) the data. 
   + Guidelines for such are presented in the respective lessons.
3. Conducting data diagnostics, this includes:
   + item and scale level missingness,
   + internal consistency coefficients (e.g., alphas or omegas) for scale scores,
   + univariate and multivariate normality
4. Beginning with a piecewise analysis of the simpler mediation and moderation(s) models in the larger model.
   + Make note of findings in each of the smaller models.
   + Changes in significance of results from smaller to larger models may indicate power problems and/or combinatorial effects of the variables.
5. Specifying and run the model overall model (this lesson presumes it will with the R package, *lavaan*).
   + The dependent variable should be predicted by the independent, mediating, and covarying (if any) variables and any of their proposed interactions.
   + “Labels” can facilitate interpretation by naming the a, b, and c’ paths.
   + Script should include calculations for the index of moderated mediation and conditional indirect and direct (if included in the model) effects.
5. Conducting a post hoc power analysis.
   + Informed by your own results, you can see if you were adequately powered to detect a statistically significant effect, if, in fact, one exists.
6. Interpret and report the results.
   + Interpret ALL the paths and their patterns.
   + Report if some indirect effects are stronger than others (i.e., results of the contrasts).
   + Create a table and figure.
   + Prepare the results in a manner that is useful to your audience.
   
In this workflow I call your attention to Hayes' [-@hayes_introduction_2022] piecewise approach to building models. I embrace this approach for a number of reasons. One reason is that examining the smaller portions of the model allows us to really begin to understand the patterns in the data in a systematic way.

Another reason I appreciate the piecewise approach are our historically rigid traditions around hypothesis testing.  In summarizing a strategic approach for testing structural equation models, Joreskog [@bollen_testing_1993] identified three scenarios:

* *strictly confirmatory*:  the traditional NHST approach of proposing a single, theoretically derived, model, and after analyzing the data either rejects or fails to reject the model.  No further modifications are made/allowed.
* *alternative models*:  the reseacher proposes competing (also theoretically derived) models.  Following analysis of a single set of empirical data, he or she selects one model as appropriate in representing the sample data.
* *model generating*:  A priori, the researcher acknowledges that they may/may not find what they have theoretically proposed. So, a priori, they acknowledge that in the absence of ideal fit (which is the usual circumstance), they will proceed in an exploratory fashion to respecify/re-estimate the model.  The goal is to find a model that is both substantively meaningful and statistically well-fitting.

A legacy of our field is the *strictly confirmatory* approach.  I am thrilled when I see research experts (e.g., [@byrne_structural_2016]) openly endorse a model building approach. 

## Research Vignette

Once again the research vignette comes from the Lewis, Williams, Peppers, and Gadson's [-@lewis_applying_2017] study titled, "Applying Intersectionality to Explore the Relations Between Gendered Racism and Health Among Black Women."  The study was published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology. Participants were 231 Black women who completed an online survey. 

Variables used in the study included:

* **GRMS**:  Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale [@lewis_construction_2015] is a 26-item scale that assesses the frequency of nonverbal, verbal, and behavioral negative racial and gender slights experienced by Black women. Scaling is along six points ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (once a week or more).  Higher scores indicate a greater frequency of gendered racial microaggressions. An example item is, "Someone has made a sexually inappropriate comment about my butt, hips, or thighs."

* **MntlHlth** and **PhysHlth**: Short Form Health Survey - Version 2 [@ware_comparison_1995] is a 12-item scale used to report self-reported mental (six items) and physical health (six items).
Higher scores indicate higher mental health (e.g., little or no psychological ldistress) and physical health (e.g., little or no reported symptoms in physical functioning). An example of an item assessing mental health was, "How much of the time during the last 4 weeks have you felt calm and peaceful?"; an example of a physical health item was, "During the past 4 weeks, how much did pain interfere with your normal work?"

* **Sprtlty**, **SocSup**, **Engmgt**, and **DisEngmt** are four subscales from the Brief Coping with Problems Experienced Inventory [@carver_you_1997]. The 28 items on this scale are presented on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (*I usually do not do this at all*) to 4(*I usually do this a lot*).  Higher scores indicate a respondents' tendency to engage in a particular strategy.  Instructions were modified to ask how the female participants responded to recent experiences of racism and sexism as Black women. The four subscales included spirituality (religion, acceptance, planning), interconnectedness/social support (vent emotions, emotional support,instrumental social support), problem-oriented/engagement coping (active coping, humor, positive reinterpretation/positive reframing), and disengagement coping (behavioral disengagement, substance abuse, denial, self-blame, self-distraction).

* **GRIcntlty**:  The Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity Centrality subscale [@sellers_multidimensional_nodate] was modified to measure the intersection of racial and gender identity centrality.  The scale included 10 items scaled from 1 (*strongly disagree*) to 7 (*strongly agree*). An example item was, "Being a *Black woman* is important to my self-image."  Higher scores indicated higher levels of gendered racial identity centrality.

### Simulating the data from the journal article

The *lavaan::simulateData* function was used. If you have taken psychometrics, you may recognize the code as one that creates latent variables form item-level data. In trying to be as authentic as possible, we retrieved factor loadings from psychometrically oriented articles that evaluated the measures [@nadal_racial_2011; @veit_structure_1983]. For all others we specified a factor loading of 0.80. We then approximated the *measurement model* by specifying the correlations between the latent variable. We sourced these from the correlation matrix from the research vignette  [@lewis_applying_2017]. The process created data with multiple decimals and values that exceeded the boundaries of the variables. For example, in all scales there were negative values. Therefore, the final element of the simulation was a linear transformation that rescaled the variables back to the range described in the journal article and rounding the values to integer (i.e., with no decimal places).

### Scrubbing, Scoring, and Data Diagnostics

Because the focus of this lesson is on moderation, we have used simulated data (which serves to avoid problems like missingness and non-normal distributions). If this were real, raw, data, it would be important to [scrub](https://lhbikos.github.io/ReC_MultivModel/scrub.html), [score](https://lhbikos.github.io/ReC_MultivModel/score.html), and conduct [data diagnostics](https://lhbikos.github.io/ReC_MultivModel/DataDx.html) to evaluate the suitability of the data for the proposes anlayses.

Because we are working with item level data we do need to score the scales used in the researcher's model. Because we are using simulated data and the authors already reverse coded any such items, we will omit that step.

As described in the [Scoring](https://lhbikos.github.io/ReC_MultivModel/score.html) chapter, we  calculate mean scores of these variables by first creating concatenated lists of variable names. Next we apply the *sjstats::mean_n* function to obtain mean scores when a given percentage (we'll specify 80%) of variables are non-missing. Functionally, this would require the two-item variables (e.g., engagement coping and disengagement coping) to have non-missingness. We simulated a set of data that does not have missingness, none-the-less, this specification is useful in real-world settings.

Note that I am only scoring the variables used in the models demonstrated in this lesson. The variables that are simulated but not scored could be used for the practice suggestions.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
GRMS_vars <- c("Ob1", "Ob2", "Ob3", "Ob4", "Ob5", "Ob6", "Ob7", "Ob8", "Ob9", "Ob10", "Ma1", "Ma2", "Ma3", "Ma4", "Ma5", "Ma6", "Ma7", "St1", "St2", "St3", "St4", "St5", "An1", "An2", "An3")
Eng_vars <- c("Eng1", "Eng2")
dEng_vars <- c("dEng1", "dEng2")
MntlHlth_vars <- c("MH1", "MH2", "MH3", "MH4", "MH5", "MH6")
Cntrlty_vars <- c("Cntrlty1", "Cntrlty2", "Cntrlty3", "Cntrlty4", "Cntrlty5", "Cntrlty6", "Cntrlty7", "Cntrlty8", "Cntrlty9", "Cntrlty10")

dfLewis$GRMS <- sjstats::mean_n(dfLewis[, GRMS_vars], 0.80)
dfLewis$Engmt <- sjstats::mean_n(dfLewis[, Eng_vars], 0.80)
dfLewis$DisEngmt <- sjstats::mean_n(dfLewis[, dEng_vars], 0.80)
dfLewis$MntlHlth <- sjstats::mean_n(dfLewis[, MntlHlth_vars], 0.80)
dfLewis$Centrality <- sjstats::mean_n(dfLewis[, Cntrlty_vars], 0.80)

#If the scoring code above does not work for you, try the format below which involves inserting to periods in front of the variable list. One example is provided.
#dfLewis$GRMS <- sjstats::mean_n(dfLewis[, ..GRMS_vars], 0.80)
```

Now that we have scored our data, let's trim the variables to just those we need.
```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
Lewis_df <- dplyr::select(dfLewis, GRMS, Centrality, DisEngmt, MntlHlth)
```

Let's check a table of means, standard deviations, and correlations to see if they align with the published article.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
Lewis_table <- apaTables::apa.cor.table(Lewis_df, table.number = 1, show.sig.stars=TRUE, landscape=TRUE, filename="Lewis_Corr.doc")
print(Lewis_table)
```

## Working the Moderated Mediation

The model we are testing is predicting a mental health (MntlHlth, Y) from gendered racial microaggressions (GRMS,X), mediated by disengagement coping (DisEngmt, M).  The relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and disengagement coping (i.e., the *a* path) is expected to be moderated by gendered racial identity centrality (GRIcntlty, W). Gendered racial identity centrality is also expected to moderate the path between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health (i.e., the *c'* path). Thus, the specified model involves the evaluation of a conditional indirect effect.

![Image of conceptual representation of the conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a and c' paths](images/ModMed/LewisModMed.jpg)

Hayes' [-@hayes_introduction_2022] textbook and training materials frequently display the conceptual (above) and statistical models (below).  These help facilitate understanding.

![Image of statistical reprsentation of the conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a and c' paths](images/ModMed/LewisStatistical.jpg)


Looking at the diagram, with two consequent variables (i.e., those with arrows pointing to them) we can see two equations are needed to explain the model:

$$M = i_{M}+a_{1}X + a_{2}W + a_{3}XW + e_{M}$$

$$Y = i_{Y}+c_{1}^{'}X+ c_{2}^{'}W+c_{3}^{'}XW+ bM+e_{Y}$$

When we have complicated models such as these, Hayes [-@hayes_introduction_2022] suggests a piecewise approach to model building. Specifically, he decompose the model into its aggregate parts:  a simple mediation and two simple moderation.

Let's start with the the simple moderations.

### Piecewise Assembly of the Moderated Mediation

#### Analysis #1:  A simple moderation

We are asking, "Does GRI centrality moderate the relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and disengagement coping?

Y = disengagement coping
X = gendered racial microaggressions
W = GRI centrality

![Image of statistical representation of the simple moderation estimating DisEngmt from GRMS, moderated by GRIcntlty](images/ModMed/LewisMod1.jpg)

The formula we are estimating:
$$Y=b_{0}+b_{1}X+b_{2}W+b_{3}XW+e_{Y}$$  

Let's specify this simple moderation model with base R's *lm()* function.  Let's use the *jtools* package so we get that great summ function and *interactions* for the awesome plot.

Since we are just working to understand our moderations, we can run them with "regular old" ordinary least squares.  

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
#library(jtools) #the summ function creates a terrific regression table
#library(interactions)
#library(ggplot2)

Mod_a_path <- lm(DisEngmt~GRMS*Centrality, data=Lewis_df)
jtools::summ(Mod_a_path, digits = 3)
```
 
Looking at these results we can see that the predictors account for about 29% of variance in disengagement coping. Only the independent variable (X), GRMS is a significant predictor.  Neither the moderator (GRIcntlty, [Y])), nor its interaction with GRMS (GRMS:GRIcntlty, [XW]) are significant.
 
It's always helpful to graph the relationship.  The *interaction_plot()* function from the package, *interactions* can make helpful illustrations.  In the case of interactions/moderations, I like to run them "both ways" to see which makes more sense.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
interactions::interact_plot(Mod_a_path, pred = GRMS, modx = Centrality) + ylim (1,4)

``` 
The figure with GRIcntrlty as the moderator, shows a very similar prediction of disengagement coping from gendered racial microaggressions across all three levels of gendered racial identity centrality.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
interactions::interact_plot(Mod_a_path, pred = Centrality, modx = GRMS) +ylim(1,4)
```

The figure that positions GRMS in the moderator role shows the significant main effect of GRMS on disengagement coping. It is clear that who experience the highest levels of gendered racial microaggressions are using a more disengaged coping style.
 
Next, let's probe the interaction with simple slopes.  Probing the interaction is a common follow-up.  With these additional inferential tests we can see where in the distribution of the moderator, X has an effect on Y that is different from zero (and where it does not). There are two common approaches.

The Johnson-Neyman is a *floodlight* approach and provides an indication of the places in the distribution of W (moderator) that X has an effect on Y that is different than zero. The *analysis of simple slopes* approach is thought of as a *spotlight* approach because probes the distribution at specific values (often the *M* +/- 1*SD*).  

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
interactions::sim_slopes(Mod_a_path, pred = GRMS, modx = Centrality)
#sim_slopes(Mod_a_path, pred=GRIcntlty, modx = GRMS) #sometimes I like to look at it in reverse -- like in the plots
```
The Johnson-Neyman suggests that between the GRIcntlty values of -6.39 and 6.37, the relationship between GRMS is statistically significant. We see the same result in the pick-a-point approach where at the GRIcntlty values of 3.18, 3.94, and 4.69, GRMS has a statistically significant effect on disengagement coping. Is this a contradiction to the non-significant interaction effect?

No. The test of interaction is an interaction about the relationship between *W* and *X*'s effect on *Y*.  Just showing that *X* is significantly related to *Y* for a specific value does not address any dependence upon the moderator (*W*).  Hayes [-@hayes_introduction_2022] covers this well in his Chapter 14, in the section "Reporting a Moderation Analysis."

**What have we learned in this simple moderation?**
 
* Only GRMS (X) has a statistically significant effect on disengagement coping.
* Neither the moderator (Centrality W) nor its interaction with GRMS (WX) are statistically significant.
While there are no significant predictors (neither X, W, nor XW)
* The model accounts for about 29% of variance in the DV.


#### Analysis #2:  Another simple moderation

We are asking, "Does gendered racial identity centrality moderate the relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health?"

Y = mental health
X = gendered racial microaggressions
W = GRI centrality

![Image of statistical representation of the simple moderation estimating MntlHlth from GRMS, moderated by GRIcntlty](images/ModMed/LewisMod2.jpg)

As before, this is our formulaic rendering:  
$$Y=b_{0}+b_{1}X+b_{2}W+b_{3}XW+e_{Y}$$  


```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
Mod_c_path <- lm(MntlHlth~GRMS*Centrality, data=Lewis_df)
jtools::summ(Mod_c_path, digits = 3)
```
 
In this model that is, overall, statistically significant, we account for about 33% of variance in the DV. Looking at these results we can see that there is a statistically significant main effect of GRMS on mental health as well as statistically significant GRMS:Centrality interaction effect.
 
Let's look at the plots.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
interactions::interact_plot(Mod_c_path, pred = GRMS, modx = Centrality) + ylim(1,6)
#interactions::interact_plot(Mod_c_path, pred = GRIcntlty, modx = GRMS + ylim(1,6))
``` 
The figure with GRIcntrlty as the moderator, shows fanning out when mental health is high and GRMS is low.
 
 
Next, let's probe the interaction with simple slopes.  Probing the interaction is a common follow-up.  With these additional inferential tests we can see where in the distribution of the moderator, X has an effect on Y that is different from zero (and where it does not). There are two common approaches.

The Johnson-Neyman is a *floodlight* approach and provides an indication of the places in the distribution of W (moderator) that X has an effect on Y that is different than zero. The *analysis of simple slopes* or *spotlight* approach, probes the distribution at specific values (often the *M* +/- 1*SD*).  

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
interactions::sim_slopes(Mod_c_path, pred = GRMS, modx = Centrality)
#sim_slopes(Mod_c_path, pred=GRIcntlty, modx = GRMS) #sometimes I like to look at it in reverse -- like in the plots
```
The Johnson-Neyman suggests that between the Centrality values of 5.92 and 58.37], the relationship between GRMS is and mental health statistically significant. We see the same result in the pick-a-point approach where at the Centrality values of 3.19, 3.94, and 4.69, GRMS has a statistically significant effect on mental health. Is this a contradiction to the non-significant interaction effect?

**What have we learned in this simple moderation?**

* There was a statistically significant main effect of GRMS on mental health as well as statistically significant GRMS:Centrality interaction effect.
* It is curious that in the presence of the statistically significant interaction effect, we did not see differences in significance in the analysis of simple slopes.
* The overall model was significant and accounted for 33% of variance in the DV.


#### Analysis #3:  A simple mediation

We are asking, "Does disengagement coping mediate the relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health?"

Y = mental health
X = gendered racial microaggressions
M = GRI centrality

![Image of statistical representation of the simple mediation estimating MntlHlth from GRMS, mediated by DisEngmt](images/ModMed/LewisMed.jpg)
Looking at the diagram, with two consequent variables (i.e., those with arrows pointing to them) we can see two equations are needed to explain the model:

$$M = i_{M}+aX + e_{M}$$

$$Y = i_{Y}+c'X+ bM+e_{Y}$$

To conduct this analysis, I am using the guidelines in the [chapter on simple mediation](#SimpleMed).  We are switching to the *lavaan* package.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
library(lavaan)

LMedModel <- '
          MntlHlth ~ b*DisEngmt + c_p*GRMS 
          DisEngmt ~a*GRMS
          
          #intercepts
          DisEngmt ~ DisEngmt.mean*1
          MntlHlth ~ MntlHlth.mean*1
          
          indirect :=  a*b
          direct  := c_p
          total_c  := c_p + (a*b)
          '
set.seed(230925) #required for reproducible results because lavaan introduces randomness into the calculations
LMed_fit <- lavaan::sem(LMedModel, data = Lewis_df, se="bootstrap", missing = 'fiml')
LMed_Sum <-  lavaan::summary(LMed_fit, standardized=T, rsq=T, ci=TRUE)
LMed_ParEsts<- lavaan::parameterEstimates(LMed_fit, boot.ci.type = "bca.simple", standardized=TRUE)
LMed_Sum
LMed_ParEsts
```

**In this simple mediation we learn***:

* The *a* path (GRMS --> DisEngmt) is statistically significant.
* The *b* path (DisEngmt --> MntlHlth) is statistically significant.
* The total effect (GRMS --> MntlHlth) is statistically significant.
* The direct effect (GRMS --> MntlHlth when DisEngmt is in the model) is still significant.
* The indirect effect is statistically significant.
* The model accounts for 36% of the variance in mental health (DV) and 28% of the variance in disengagement coping (M).

Recall how the bootstrapped, bias-corrected confidence intervals can be different?  It's always good to check.  In this case, CI95s and the $p$ values are congruent.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
#only worked when I used the library to turn on all these pkgs
library(lavaan)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidySEM)
tidySEM::graph_sem(model = LMed_fit)
```
We can use the *tidySEM::get_layout* function to understand how our model is being mapped.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
tidySEM::get_layout(LMed_fit)
```
We can write code to remap them
```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
Lmedmap <- tidySEM::get_layout("", "DisEngmt", "",
                               "GRMS", "", "MntlHlth",  rows=2)
Lmedmap
```
We can update the *tidySEM::graph_sem* function with our new model to produce something that will better convey our analyses and its results.
```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70)}
tidySEM::graph_sem(LMed_fit, layout=Lmedmap,  rect_width = 1.25, rect_height = 1.25, spacing_x = 2, spacing_y = 3, text_size = 4.5)
```


## The Moderated Mediation:  A Combined analysis

For a quick reminder, the diagram with labeled paths will help specify this in *lavaan*.

![Image of statistical reprsentation of the conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a and c' paths](images/ModMed/LewisStatistical.jpg)


Looking at the diagram, with two consequent variables (i.e., those with arrows pointing to them) we can see two equations are needed to explain the model:

$$M = i_{M}+a_{1}X + a_{2}W + a_{3}XW + e_{M}$$

$$Y = i_{Y}+c_{1}^{'}X+ c_{2}^{'}W+c_{3}^{'}XW+ bM+e_{Y}$$
Y = MntlHlth
X = GRMS
W = DisEngmt
M = GRIcntlty

### Specification in *lavaan*

In the code below

* First specify the equations, hints
    + the a,b,c, labels are affixed with the *(asterisk)
    + interaction terms are identifed with the colon
* Create code for the intercepts (Y and M) with the form:  VarName ~ VarName.mean*1
* Create code for the mean and variance of all moderators (W, Z, etc.); these will be used in simple slopes.
    + Means use the form:  VarName ~ VarName.mean*1
    + Variances use the form:  VarName ~~VarName.var*VarName
* Calculate the *index of moderated mediation*:  quantifies the relationship between the moderator and the indirect effect.  
    + To the degree that the value of the IMM is different from zero and the associated inferential test is statistically significant (bootstrapped confidence intervals are preferred; more powerful), we can conclude that the indirect effect is moderated.
      + The IMM is used in the formula to calculate the conditional indirect effects.
      +  Hayes argues that a statistically significant IMM suggest they are (boom, done, p. 430).
* Create code to calculate indirect effects conditional on (*M* +/- 1*SD*) moderator with the general form:
    + product of the indirect effect (a*b) PLUS
    + the product of the IMM and the moderated value
* Because our direct path is moderated, we will use a similar process to specify the direct effects conditional on (*M* +/- 1*SD*) moderator with the general form:
    + the direct effect (c_p1) PLUS
    + the moderated value (c_p3) at each of the three levels (*M* +/- 1*SD*) 
* Although they don't tend to be reported, you can create total effects conditional on the (*M* +/- 1*SD*).  These are simply the sum of the c_p and all indirect paths, specified individually, at their *M* +/- 1*SD* conditional values.

### Beginning the interpretation

We have already looked at some of the simple effects found within the more complex model.  Let's grab the formulae.

$$\hat{M} = i_{M}+a_{1}X + a_{2}W + a_{3}XW + e_{M}$$


$$\hat{Y} = i_{Y}+c_{1}^{'}X+ c_{2}^{'}W+c_{3}^{'}XW+ bM+e_{Y}$$

And substitute in our values

$$\hat{M} = 1.417 + 0.212X + (-0.027) W + 0.006XW$$
$$\hat{Y} = 31.703 + (-1.4115)X + (-0.556)W + 0.164XW + (-3.567)M$$

|*Note*. GRMS = gendered racial microaggressions. The significance of the indirect effects was calculated with bootstrapped, bias-corrected, confidence intervals (.95).|


Thirty one percent of the variance in disengagement coping (mediator) and 46% of the variance in mental health (DV) are predicted by their respective models.

The model we tested suggested that both the indirect and direct effects should be moderated. 

#### Conditional Indirect effects 

An indirect effect can be moderated if either the *a* or *b* path (or both) is(are) moderated.  If at least one of the indirect paths is part of a moderation, then the whole indirect (axb) path would be moderated. In this model, we specified a moderation of the *a* path. We know the *a* path is moderated if the moderation term is statistically significant.  

In our case, $a_{3}$ GRMS:Centrality was not statistically significant $(B = -0.058, p = 0.253)$. We also inspect the *Index of Moderated Mediation*. The IMM is the product of the moderated path (in this case, the value of $a_{3}$) and *b*.  If this index is 0, then the slope of the line for the indirect effect is flat. The bootstrap confidence interval associated with this test is the way to determine whether/not this slope is statistically significant from zero. In our case, IMM = 0.021 ($p = 0.287%) with the 95% confidence interval ranging from  CI095 = -0.017 to	0.063. This suggests that we do not have a moderated mediation.  Hayes claims the IMM saves us from formally comparing (think "contrasts" pairs of conditional indirect effects).

We can obtain more information about the potentially moderated indirect effect  by *probing the conditional indirect effect*.  Because an indirect effect is not normally distributed, Hayes discourages using a Johnson-Neyman approach and suggests that we use a pick-a-point.  He usually selects the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles of the distribution. However, many researchers commonly report the mean+/-1SD.

  * at 1SD below the mean $B = -0.159, p <0.001, 95CI(-0.253,	-0.083)$; 
  * at the mean $B = -0.488, p <0.001, 95CI(-0.613,	-0.355)$;  
  * at 1SD above the mean, $B = -0.128, p = 0.002, 95CI(-0.229,	-0.061)$.  

Examining the relative consistency of the $B$ weights and the consistently significant $p$ values, we see that there was an indirect effect throughout the varying levels of the moderator, gendered racial identity centrality.  Thus, it makes sense that this was not a *moderated mediation*.


#### Conditional Direct effect

The direct effect of X to Y estimates how differences in X relate to differences in Y holding constant the proposed mediator(s). We know the direct effect is moderated if the interaction term $(c'_p3)$is statistically significant.  In our case, it was not $B = 0.136, p = 0.066$.  Probing a conditional direct effect is straightforward -- we typically use the same points as we did in the probing of the conditional indirect effect.

  * at 1SD below the mean $B = -0.591, p <0.001, 95CI(-0.754,	-0.410)$; 
  * at the mean $B-0.143, p <0.001, 95CI(-0.226,	-0.073)$;  
  * at 1SD above the mean, $B = -0.386, p <0.001, 95CI(-0.549,	-0.218)$.  
  
The statistically significant effect of GRMS on mental health at the three levels of gendered racial identity centrality is consistent with the non-significant interaction effect.

### Model trimming

Hayes terms it *pruning* when he suggests that when there is no moderation of an effect, the researcher may want to delete that interaction term.  In our case, neither the direct nor indirect effect was moderated (although the +1*SD* was close ($B = 0.136, p = 0.066$).  Deleting these paths one at a time is typical practice because the small boost of power with each deleted path may "turn on" significance elsewhere. If I were to engage in model trimming, I would start with the indirect effect to see if the interaction term associated with the direct effect became statistically significant. This is consistent with the simple moderation we ran earlier where we saw a fanning out at one end of the distribution.

### APA Style Write-up

As we look to write up our own results I encourage you to review the manuscript that sources our research vignette. The Lewis et al. [-@lewis_applying_2017] write-up is an efficient one, simultaneously presenting the results of two outcome variables -- mental and physical health. While our *B* weights from our simulated data map similarly onto those reported in the Lewis et al. manuscript, we do not get get the statistically significant moderated mediation reported in the article.

**Method/Analytic Strategy**

Data were analyzed with a maximum likelihood approach the package, *lavaan* (v. 0.6-16). We specified a moderated mediation model predicting mental health from gendered racial microaggressions, mediated by disengagement coping. We further predicted that the relationships between gendered racial microaggressions to disengagement coping (i.e., the *a* path) and between gendered racial microaggressions to mental health (i.e., the $c^1$ path) would be moderated by gendered racial identity centrality.

**Primary Analyses**
Our analysis evaluated a moderation mediation model predicting mental health (Y/MntlHlth) from gendered racial microaggressions (X/GRMS) mediated by disengagement coping (M/DisEngmt).  Gendered racial identity centrality (W/GRIcntrlty) was our moderating variable.  We specified a moderation of path *a* (X/GRMS to M/DisEngmt) and the direct path, *c'* (X/GRMS to Y/MntlHlth). Data were analyzed with maximum likelihood estimation in the R package *lavaan* (v. 0.6-7); the significance of effects were tested with 1000 bootstrap confidence intervals. Results of the full model are presented in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1 (*a variation of the semPlot or Hayes style representation*).  The formula for the mediator and dependent variable are expressed below.  


$$\hat{M} = 1.107 + 0.623X + (0.093) W + -0.058XW$$
$$\hat{Y} = 6.539 + (-1.023)X + (-0.317)W +0.136XW + (-0.362)M$$

Results suggested a negative effect of gendered racial microaggressions on mental health that is mediated through disengagement coping. That is, in the presence of gendered racial microaggressions, participants increased disengagement coping which, in turn, had negative effects on mental health. The index of moderated mediation was not significant $(B = 0.021, p = 0.287, 95CI(-0.017,	0.063)$, suggesting that the indirect effects were not conditional on the values of the moderator. While there was no evidence of moderation on the indirect or direct paths, there was a statistically significant, and consistently strong, mediation throughout the range of the gendered racial identity centrality (moderator).  *Because we did not have a moderated mediation, I would probably not include the rest of this paragraph (nor include the moderation figure).  I just wanted to demonstrate how to talk about findings if they were significant (although I acnowledg throughat that these are non-significant).* Figure 2 illustrates the conditional effects (non-significant) of GRMS (X) on mental health (Y) among those at the traditional levels of $M \pm 1SD$.  Our model accounted for 31% of the variance in the mediator (disengagement coping) and 46% of the variance in the dependent variable (mental health).

## STAY TUNED

A section on power analysis is planned and coming soon! My apologies that it's not quite *R*eady.

## Residual and Related Questions...

..that you might have; or at least I had, but if had answered them earlier it would have disrupt the flow.

1. Would you stop here?  Or keep tinkering?
   * I am tempted to delete moderation of the indirect effect to see if I can get a moderated direct effect. My choice would also depend on to what I committed in any kind of pre-registration. My approach to science tends to be *model generating* [@bollen_testing_1993] and in his text, Hayes [-@hayes_introduction_2022] advised authors to write about what they found -- not all the things they tried. This *tinkering* remains strongly in the vein of theoretically driven analyses.
2. The output we get is different from the output in the journal article being used as the research vignette.  Why?  And should we worry about it? 
   * We are simulating data.  This gives us some advantages in that (unless we specify it), we never have missingness and our variables should be normally distributed. Because we are working from means and correlations, our data will never be the same as the original researcher.  
3. Some of the statistics you are reporting are different than the ones in Hayes and the ones that use the PROCESS macro (e.g., what happened to the *F* test)?
   *  The default estimator for *lavaan* is maximum likelihood (ML) and Hayes uses ordinary least squares (OLS).  This affects both the values of coefficients, standard errors, AND the type of statistics that are reported. 
   *  You can ask for OLS regression by adding the statement "estimator = "GLS". Even with this option, I have not discovered a way to obtain the *F* tests for the overall model.  Researchers seem to be comfortable with this, even asking for less than we did (e.g., many do not request R square).
   * Best I can tell, researchers who do want this might use a combination of packages, using GLS estimators in *lavaan* (this easily gets them the bootstrapped CIs) and the move to a different regression package to get the intercepts and *F* tests.  If I did this I would triple check to make sure that all the output really lined up.
4. Why did you run the two simple moderations with the base R *lm()* function (in OLS) and the moderated mediation in *lavaan* (using MLE)?
   * As demonstrated in the prior chapter on simple moderation, the regression weights associated with the OLS and MLE analyses should be the same. Given that I'm conducting the simple mediations and moderations with a primary purpose of understanding the simpler elements of the larger model, either approach will be useful in helping me understand the smaller sets of relations.
   * Very practically, using the base R *lm()* approach will help me create interaction plots that will be useful in presenting the results.
5. Why did we ignore the traditional fit statistics associated with structural equation modeling (e.g., CFI, RMSEA). 
   * I hesitate to do this with models that do not include latent variables.  Therefore, we asked for an "in-between" amount of info that should be sufficient for publication submission (any editor may have their own preferences and ask for more).
6. What if I have missing data?
   *  When we enter the *lavaan* world we do get options other than multiple imputation.  In today's example we used the "sem" fitting function. Unless otherwise specified, listwise deletion (deleting the entire case when one of its variables is used to estimate the model) is the default in *lavaan*.  If data are MCAR or MAR, you can add the argument *missing = "ml"* (or its alias *missing = "fiml"*).  More here https://users.ugent.be/~yrosseel/lavaan/lavaan2.pdf on the 1.7/Missing data in lavaan slide.
   * That said, the type of estimator matters.  If you estimate your data with GLS (generalized least squares) or WLS (weighted least squares), you are required to have complete data (however you got it).  We used maximum likelihood and, even though we had non-missing data, I used the *missing = "fiml"* code.

   
## Practice Problems

The three problems described below were designed to grow during the series of chapters on simple and complex mediation, complex moderation, and conditional process analysis (i.e,. this chapter). I have recommended that you select a dataset that includes at least four variables. If you are new to this topic, you may wish to select variables that are all continuously scaled.  The IV and moderator (next chapters) could be categorical (if they are dichotomous, please use 0/1 coding; if they have more than one category it is best if they are ordered).  You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis.

The suggested practice problem for this chapter is to conduct a moderated mediation. At least one path (a or b) should be moderated.

### Problem #1: Rework the research vignette as demonstrated, but change the random seed

If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation, then rework the problem. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar.


### Problem #2:  Rework the research vignette, but swap one or more variables

Use the simulated data, but select one of the other models that was evaluated in the Lewis et al. [-@lewis_applying_2017] study. For example, physical health was also used as a dependent variable in a separate but otherwise parallel analysis.  Compare your results to those reported in the mansucript.


### Problem #3:  Use other data that is available to you

Using data for which you have permission and access (e.g.,  IRB approved data you have collected or from your lab; data you simulate from a published article; data from an open science repository; data from other chapters in this OER), complete a simple mediation.
