Early drafts are released for the purpose teaching my classes and gaining formative feedback from a host of stakeholders. The document was last updated on 30 Apr 2021 Screencasted Lecture Link To center a variable in regression means to set its value at zero and interpret all other values in relation to this reference point. Regarding race and gender, researchers often center male and White at zero. Further, it is typical that research vignettes in statistics textbooks are similarly seated in a White, Western (frequently U.S.), heteronormative, framework. The purpose of this project is to create a set of open educational resources (OER) appropriate for doctoral and post-doctoral training that contribute to a socially responsive pedagogy  that is, it contributes to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. Statistics training in doctoral programs are frequently taught with fee-for-use programs (e.g., SPSS/AMOS, SAS, MPlus) that may not be readily available to the post-doctoral professional. In recent years, there has been an increase and improvement in R packages (e.g., psych, lavaan) used for in analyses common to psychological research. Correspondingly, many graduate programs are transitioning to statistics training in R (free and open source). This is a challenge for post-doctoral psychologists who were trained with other software. This OER will offer statistics training with R and be freely available (specifically in a GitHub respository and posted through GitHub Pages) under a Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike license [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0]. Training models for doctoral programs in HSP are commonly scholar-practitioner, scientist-practitioner, or clinical-scientist. An emerging model, the scientist-practitioner-advocacy training model incorporates social justice advocacy so that graduates are equipped to recognize and address the sociocultural context of oppression and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities (Mallinckrodt et al., 2014). In statistics textbooks, the use of research vignettes engages the learner around a tangible scenario for identifying independent variables, dependent variables, covariates, and potential mechanisms of change. Many students recall examples in Fields (2012) popular statistics text: Viagra to teach one-way ANOVA, beer goggles for two-way ANOVA, and bushtucker for repeated measures. What if the research vignettes were more socially responsive? In this OER, research vignettes will be from recently published articles where: the authors identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC[low-middle income countries]), the research is responsive to issues of justice, equity, inclusion, diversity, the lessons statistic is used in the article, and there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s); or it is publicly available. In training for multicultural competence, the saying, A fish doesnt know that its wet is often used to convey the notion that we are often unaware of our own cultural characteristics. In recent months and years, there has been an increased awakening to the institutional and systemic racism that our systems are perpetuating. Queuing from the water metaphor, I am hopeful that a text that is recentered in the ways I have described can contribute to changing the water in higher education and in the profession of psychology.

"],["acknowledgements.html", "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", " ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS As a doctoral student at the University of Kansas (1992-2005), I learned that a foreign language was required for graduation. Please note that as one who studies the intersections of global, vocational, and sustainable psychology, I regret that I do not have language skills beyond English. This could have been met with credit from high school my rural, mid-Missouri high school did not offer such classes. This requirement would have typically been met with courses taken during an undergraduate program  but my non-teaching degree in the University of Missouris School of Education was exempt from this. The requirement could have also been met with a computer language (fortran, C++)  I did not have any of those either. There was a tiny footnote on my doctoral degree plan that indicated that a 2-credit course, SPSS for Windows would substitute for the language requirement. Given that it was taught by my one of my favorite professors, I readily signed up. As it turns out, Samuel B. Green, PhD, was using the course to draft chapters in the textbook (Green &amp; Salkind, 2014) that has been so helpful for so many. Unfortunately, Drs. Green (1947 - 2018) and Salkind (2947 - 2017) are no longer with us. I have worn out numerous versions of their text. Another favorite text of mine was Dr. Barbara Byrnes (2016), Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS. I loved the way she worked through each problem and paired it with a published journal article, so that the user could see how the statistical evaluation fit within the larger project/article. I took my tea-stained text with me to a workshop she taught at APA and was proud of the signature she added to it (a little catfur might have fallen out). Dr. Byrne created SEM texts for a number of statistical programs (e.g., LISREL, EQS, MPlus). As I was learning R, I wrote Dr. Byrne, asking if she had an edition teaching SEM/CFA with R. She promptly wrote back, saying that she did not have the bandwidth to learn a new statistics package. We lost Dr. Byrne in December 2020. I am so grateful to these role models for their contributions to my statistical training. I am also grateful for the doctoral students who have taken my courses and are continuing to provide input for how to improve the materials. The inspiration for training materials that re*center statistics and research methods came from the Academics for Black Survival and Wellness Initiative. This project, co-founded by Della V. Mosley, Ph.D., and Pearis L. Bellamy, M.S., made clear the necessity and urgency for change in higher education and the profession of psychology. At very practical levels, I am indebted to SPUs Library, and more specifically, SPUs Education, Technology, and Media Department. Assistant Dean for Instructional Design and Emerging Technologies, R. John Robertson, MSc, MCS, has offered unlimited consultation, support, and connection. Senior Instructional Designer in Graphics &amp; Illustrations, Dominic Wilkinson, designed the logo and bookcover. Psychology and Scholarly Communications Librarian, Kristin Hoffman, MLIS, has provided consultation on topics ranging from OERS to citations. I am alo indebted to Associate Vice President, Teaching and Learning at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Rajiv Jhangiani, PhD. Dr. Jhangianis text (2019) was the first OER I ever used and I was grateful for his encouraging conversation. Financial support for this text has been provided from the Call to Action on Equity, Inclusion, Diversity, Justice, and Social Responsivity Request for Proposals grant from the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (2021-2022). "],["ReCintro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 What to expect in each chapter 1.2 Strategies for Accessing and Using this OER 1.3 If You are New to R", " Chapter 1 Introduction Screencasted Lecture Link 1.1 What to expect in each chapter This textbook is intended as applied, in that a primary goal is to help the scientist-practitioner-advocate use a variety of statistics in research problems and writing them up for a program evaluation, dissertation, or journal article. In support of that goal, I try to provide just enough conceptual information so that the researcher can select the appropriate statistic (i.e., distinguishing between when ANOVA is appropriate and when regression is appropriate) and assign variables to their proper role (e.g., covariate, moderator, mediator). This conceptual approach does include occasional, step-by-step, hand-calculations (only we calculate them arithmetically in R) to provide a visceral feeling of what is happening within the statistical algorithm that may be invisible to the researcher. Additionally, the conceptual review includes a review of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data and research design that are required for the statistic. Statistics can be daunting, so I have worked hard to establish a workflow through each analysis. When possible, I include a flowchart that is referenced frequently in each chapter and assists the the researcher keep track of their place in the many steps and choices that accompany even the simplest of analyses. As with many statistics texts, each chapter includes a research vignette. Somewhat unique to this resource is that the vignettes are selected from recently published articles. Each vignette is chosen with the intent to meet as many of the following criteria as possible: the statistic that is the focus of the chapter was properly used in the article, the authors identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC [low middle income countries]), the research has a justice, equity, inclusion, diversity, and social responsivity focus and will contribute positively to a social justice pedagogy, and the data is available in a repository or there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s). In each chapter we employ R packages that will efficiently calculate the statistic and the dashboard of metrics (e.g., effect sizes, confidence intervals) that are typically reported in psychological science. 1.2 Strategies for Accessing and Using this OER There are a number of ways you can access this resource. You may wish to try several strategies and then select which works best for you. I demonstrate these in the screencast that accompanies this chapter. Simply follow along in the .html formatted document that is available on via GitHub Pages, and then open a fresh .rmd file of your own, copying (or retyping) the script and running it Locate the original documents at the GitHub repository . You can open them to simply take note of the behind the scenes script copy/download individual documents that are of interest to you fork a copy of the entire project to your own GitHub site and further download it (in its entirety) to your personal workspace. The GitHub Desktop app makes this easy! Listen to the accompanying lectures (I think sound best when the speed is 1.75). The lectures are being recorded in Panopto and should include the closed captioning. Provide feedback to me! If you fork a copy to your own GitHub repository, you can open up an editing tool and mark up the document with your edits, start a discussion by leaving comments/questions, and then sending them back to me by committing and saving. I get an e-mail notiying me of this action. I can then review (accepting or rejecting) them and, if a discussion is appropriate, reply back to you. 1.3 If You are New to R R can be oveRwhelming. Jumping right into advanced statistics might not be the easiest way to start. However, in these chapters, I provide complete code for every step of the process, starting with uploading the data. To help explain what R script is doing, I sometimes write it in the chapter text; sometimes leave hastagged-comments in the chunks; and, particularly in the accompanying screencasted lectures, try to take time to narrate what the R script is doing. Ive found that, somewhere on the internet, theres almost always a solution to what Im trying to do. I am frequently stuck and stumped and have spent hours searching the internet for even the tiniest of things. When you watch my videos, you may notice that in my R studio, there is a scRiptuRe file. I takes notes on the solutions and scripts here  using keywords that are meaningful to me so that when I need to repeat the task, I can hopefully search my own prior solutions and find a fix or a hint. 1.3.1 Base R The base program is free and is available here: https://www.r-project.org/ Because R is already on my machine (and because the instructions are sufficient), I will not walk through the instllation, but I will point out a few things. Follow the instructions for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux) The cran (I think cranium) is the Comprehensive R Archive Network. In order for R to run on your computer, you have to choose a location. Because proximity is somewhat related to processing speed, select one that is geographically close to you. You will see the results of this download on your desktop (or elsewhere if you chose to not have it appear there) but you wont ever use R through this platform. 1.3.2 R Studio R Studio is the desktop application I work in R. Its a separate download. Choose the free, desktop, option that is appropriate for your operating system: https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/ Upper right window: Includes several tabs; we frequently monitor the Environment: it lists the objects that are available to you (e.g., dataframes) Lower right window: has a number of helpful tabs. Files: Displays the file structure in your computers environment. Make it a practice to (a) organize your work in small folders and (b) navigating to that small folder that is holding your project when you are working on it. Packages: Lists the packages that have been installed. If you navigate to it, you can see if it is on. You can also access information about the package (e.g., available functions, examples of script used with the package) in this menu. This information opens in the Help window. Viewer and Plots are helpful, later, when we can simultaneously look at our output and still work on our script. Primary window R Studio runs in the background(in the console). Very occasionally, I can find useful troubleshooting information here. More commonly, I open my R Markdown document so that it takes the whole screen and I work directly, right here. R Markdown is the way that many analysts write script, conduct analyses, and even write up results. These are saved as .rmd files. In R Studio, open an R Markdown document through File/New File/R Markdown Specify the details of your document (title, author, desired ouput) In a separate step, SAVE this document (File/Save] into a NEW FILE FOLDER that will contain anything else you need for your project (e.g., the data). Packages are at the heart of working in R. Installing and activating packages require writing script. 1.3.3 R Hygiene Many initial problems in R can be solved with good R hygiene. Here are some suggestions for basic practices. It can be tempting to skip this. However, in the first few weeks of class, these are the solutions I am presenting to my students. 1.3.3.1 Everything is documented in the .rmd file Although others do it differently, everything is in my .rmd file. That is, for uploading data and opening packages I write the code in my .rmd file. Why? Because when I read about what I did hours or years later, I have a permanent record of very critical things like (a) where my data is located, (b) what version I was using, and (c) what package was associated with the functions. 1.3.3.2 File organization File organization is a critical key to this: Create a project file folder. Put the data file in it. Open an R Markdown file. Save it in the same file folder. When your data and .rmd files are in the same folder (not your desktop, but a shared folder), they can be connected. 1.3.3.3 Chunks The R Markdown document is an incredible tool for integrating text, tables, and analyses. This entire OER is written in R Markdown. A central feature of this is chunks. The easiest way to insert a chunk is to use the INSERT/R command at the top of this editor box. You can also insert a chunk with the keyboard shortcut: CTRL/ALT/i Chunks start and end with with those three tic marks and will show up in a shaded box, like this: #hashtags let me write comments to remind myself what I did #here I am simply demonstrating arithmetic (but I would normally be running code) 2021 - 1966 ## [1] 55 Each chunk must open and close. If one or more of your tic marks get deleted, your chunk wont be read as such and your script will not run. The only thing in the chunks should be script for running R; you can hashtag-out script so it wont run. Although unnecessary, you can add a brief title for the chunk in the opening row, after the r. These create something of a table of contents of all the chunks  making it easier to find what you did. You can access them in the Chunks tab at the bottom left of R Studio. If you wish to knit a document, you cannot have identical chunk titles. You can put almost anything you want in the space outside of tics. Syntax for simple formatting in the text areas (e.g,. using italics, making headings, bold, etc.) is found here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html 1.3.3.4 Packages As scientist-practitioners (and not coders), we will rely on packages to do our work for us. At first you may feel overwhelmed about the large number of packages that are available. Soon, though, you will become accustomed to the ones most applicable to our work (e.g., psych, tidyverse, lavaan, apaTables). Researchers treat packages differently. In these lectures, I list all the packages we will use in an opening chunk that asks R to check to see if the package is installed, and if not, installs it. if(!require(psych)){install.packages(&quot;psych&quot;)} ## Loading required package: psych To make a package operable, you need to open it through the library. This process must be repeated each time you restart R. I dont open the package (through the library(package_name)) command until it is time to use it. Especially for new users, I think its important to connect the functions with the specific packages. #install.packages (&quot;psych&quot;) library (psych) If you type in your own install.packages code, hashtag it out once its been installed. It is problematic to continue to re-run this code . 1.3.3.5 Knitting An incredible feature of R Markdown is its capacity to knit to HTML, powerpoint, or word. If you access the .rmd files for this OER, you can use annotate or revise them to suit your purposes. If you redistribute them, though, please honor the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License with a citation. 1.3.4 tRoubleshooting in R maRkdown Hiccups are normal. Here are some ideas that I have found useful in getting unstuck. In an R script, you must have everything in order  Every. Single. Time. All the packages have to be in your library and activated; if you restart R, you need to reload each package. If you open an .rmd file and want a boxplot, you cannot just scroll down to that script. You need to run any prerequisite script (like loading the package, importing data, putting the data in the global environment, etc.) Do you feel lost? clear your global environment (broom) and start at the top of the R script. Frequent, fresh starts are good. Your .rmd file and your data need to be stored in the same file folder. These should be separate for separate projects, no matter how small. Type any warnings you get into a search engine. Odds are, youll get some decent hints in a manner of seconds. Especially at first, these are common errors: The package isnt loaded (if you restarted R, you need to reload your packages) The .rmd file has been saved yet, or isnt saved in the same folder as the data Errors of punctuation or spelling Restart R (its quick  not like restarting your computer) If you receive an error indicating that a function isnt working or recognized, and you have loaded the package, type the name of the package in front of the function with two colons (e.g., psych::describe(df). If multiple packages are loaded with functions that have the same name, R can get confused. 1.3.5 stRategies for success Engage with R, but dont let it overwhelm you. The mechanical is also the conceptual. Especially when it is simpler, do try to retype the script into your own .rmd file and run it. Track down the errors you are making and fix them. If this stresses you out, move to simply copying the code into the .rmd file and running it. If you continue to have errors, you may have violated one of the best practices above (Is the package loaded? Are the data and .rmd files in the same place? Is all the prerequisite script run?). Still overwhelmed? Keep moving forward by downloading a copy of the .rmd file that accompanies any given chapter and just run it along with the lecture. Spend your mental power trying to understand what each piece does. Then select a practice problem that is appropriate for your next level of growth. Copy script that works elsewhere and replace it with your datafile, variables, etc. The leaRning curve is steep, but not impossible. Gladwell(2008) reminds us that it takes about 10,000 hours to get GREAT at something (2,000 to get reasonably competent). Practice. Practice. Practice. Updates to R, R Studio, and the packages are NECESSARY, but can also be problematic. It could very well be that updates cause programs/script to fail (e.g., X has been deprecated for version X.XX). Moreover, this very well could have happened between my distribution of these resources and your attempt to use it. My personal practice is to update R, R Studio, and the packages a week or two before each academic term. Embrace your downward dog. Also, walk away, then come back. 1.3.6 Resources for getting staRted R for Data Science: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ R Cookbook: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809164.do R Markdown homepage with tutorials: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html R has cheatsheets for everything, heres one for R Markdown: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf R Markdown Reference guide: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf Using R Markdown for writing reproducible scientific papers: https://libscie.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop/handout.html LaTeX equation editor: https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php "],["dataprep.html", "DATA PREP", " DATA PREP "],["scrub.html", "Chapter 2 Scrubbing 2.1 Navigating this Lesson 2.2 Workflow for Scrubbing and Scoring 2.3 Research Vignette 2.4 Working the Problem 2.5 Scrubbing 2.6 Toward the APA Style Write-up 2.7 Practice Problems 2.8 Bonus Track:", " Chapter 2 Scrubbing Screencasted Lecture Link The focus of this chapter is the process of starting with raw data and preparing it for multivariate analysis. To that end, we will address the conceptual considerations and practical steps in scrubbing and scoring. A twist in this lesson is that I am asking you to contribute to the dataset that serves as the basis for the chapter and the practice problems. In the spirit of open science, this dataset is available to you and others for your own learning. Before continuing, please take 15-20 minutes to complete the survey titled, Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise. The study is approved by the Institutional Review Board at Seattle Pacific University (SPUIRB# 202102011, no expiration). Details about the study, including an informed consent, are included at the link. 2.1 Navigating this Lesson There is about 90 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be good to add another hour. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OERs introduction 2.1.1 Learning Objectives Learning objectives from this lecture include the following: Import data from Qualtrics into R. Begin the scrubbing process by applying exclusion and inclusion criteria. Rename variables. Create a smaller dataframe with variables appropriate for testing a specific statistical model. Use critical data manipulation functions from the tidyverse (and dplyr) in particular such as filter(), select(), and mutate() to prepare variables. Articulate the initial steps in a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. 2.1.2 Planning for Practice The suggestions for practice will start with this chapter and continue in the next two chapters (Scoring, Data Dx). Using Parents (2013) AIA approach to managing missing data, you will scrub-and-score a raw dataset. Options of graded complexity could incude: Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written. Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose. Hey :) Begin with raw data to which you have access. 2.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s).

An image of a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. Here is a narration of the figure: The workflow begins by importing data into R. Most lessons in this series involve simulated data that are created directly in R. Alternatively, data could be: imported intRavenously through programs such as Qualtrics, exported from programs such as Qualtrics to another program (e.g., .xlxs, .csv), imported in other forms (e.g., .csv,.sps, .sav). Scrubbing data by variable naming, specifying variable characteristics such as factoring, ensuring that included particpiants consented to participation, determining and executing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Conduct preliminary data diagnostics such as outlier anlaysis assessing for univariate and multivariate analysis making transformations and/or corrections Managing missingness by one of two routes Available information analysis (Parent, 2013) at either the item-level or scale level. The result is a single set of data for analysis. If missingness remains, options include pairwise deletion, listwise deletion, or specifying FIML (when available). Another option is to use multiple imputation. Multiple imputation at either scale level or item-level 2.3 Research Vignette To provide first-hand experience as both the respondent and analyst for the same set of data, you were asked to complete a survey titled, Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise. If you havent yet completed it, please consider doing so, now. In order to reduce the potential threats to validity by providing background information about the survey, I will wait to describe it until later in the chapter. The survey is administered in Qualtrics. In the chapter I teach two ways to import Qualtrics data into R. We will then use the data to work through the steps identified in the workflow. 2.4 Working the Problem 2.4.1 intRavenous Qualtrics I will demonstrate using a Qualtrics account at my institution, Seattle Pacific University. The only surveys in this account are for the Recentering Psych Stats chapters and lessons. All surveys are designed to not capture personally identifying information. Access credentials for the institutional account, individual users account, and survey are essential for getting the survey items and/or results to export into R. The Qualtrics website provides a tutorial for generating an API token. We need two pieces of information: the root_url and an API token. Log into your respective qualtrics.com account. Select Account Settings Choose Qualtrics IDs from the user name dropdown We need the root_url. This is the first part of the web address for the Qualtrics account. For our institution it is: spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com The API token is in the box labeled, API. If it is empty, select, Generate Token. If you do not have this option, locate the brand administrator for your Qualtrics account. They will need to set up your account so that you have API privileges. BE CAREFUL WITH THE API TOKEN This is the key to your Qualtrics accounts. If you leave it in an .rmd file that you forward to someone else, this key and the base URL gives access to every survey in your account. If you share it, you could be releasing survey data to others that would violate confidentiality promises in an IRB application. If you mistakenly give out your API token you can generate a new one within your Qualtrics account and re-protect all its contents. You do need to change the API key/token if you want to download data from a different Qualtrics account. If your list of surveys generates the wrong set of surveys, restart R, make sure you have the correct API token and try again. #only have to run this ONCE to draw from the same Qualtrics account...but will need to get different token if you are changing between accounts library(qualtRics) #qualtrics_api_credentials(api_key = &quot;mUgPMySYkiWpMFkwHale1QE5HNmh5LRUaA8d9PDg&quot;, #base_url = &quot;spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com&quot;, overwrite = TRUE, install = TRUE) all_surveys() generates a dataframe containing information about all the surveys stored on your Qualtrics account. surveys &lt;- all_surveys() #View this as an object (found in the right: Environment). #Get survey id # for the next command #If this is showing you the WRONG list of surveys, you are pulling from the wrong Qualtrics account (i.e., maybe this one instead of your own). Go back and change your API token (it saves your old one). Changing the API likely requires a restart of R. surveys To retrieve the survey, use the fetch_survey() function. #obtained with the survey ID #&quot;surveyID&quot; should be the ID from above #&quot;verbose&quot; prints messages to the R console #&quot;label&quot;, when TRUE, imports data as text responses; if FALSE prints the data as numerical responses #&quot;convert&quot;, when TRUE, attempts to convert certain question types to the &quot;proper&quot; data type in R; because I don&#39;t like guessing, I want to set up my own factors. #&quot;force_request&quot;, when TRUE, always downloads the survey from the API instead of from a temporary directory (i.e., it always goes to the primary source) # &quot;import_id&quot;, when TRUE includes the unique Qualtrics-assigned ID; since I have provided labels, I want false #Out of the blue, I started getting an error, that R couldn&#39;t find function &quot;fetch_survey.&quot; After trying a million things, adding qualtRics:: to the front of it solved the problem QTRX_df &lt;-qualtRics::fetch_survey(surveyID = &quot;SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU&quot;, time_zone = NULL, verbose = FALSE, label=FALSE, convert=FALSE, force_request = TRUE, import_id = FALSE) #useLocalTime = TRUE, It is possible (and helpful, even) to import Qualtrics data that has been downloaded from Qualtrics as a .csv. I demo this in the Bonus Reel. 2.4.2 About the Rate-a-Recent-Course Survey As a teaching activity for the ReCentering Psych Stats OER, the topic of the survey was selected to be consistent with the overall theme of OER. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to understand the campus climate for students whose identities make them vulnerable to bias and discrimination. These include students who are Black, non-Black students of color, LGBTQ+ students, international students, and students with disabilities. Although the dataset should provide the opportunity to test a number of statistical models, one working hypothesis that framed the study is that the there will be a greater sense of belonging and less bias and discrimination when there is similar representation (of identities that are often marginalized) in the instructional faculty and student body. Termed, structural diversity (K. R. Lewis &amp; Shah, 2019) this is likely an oversimplification. In fact, an increase in diverse representation without attention to interacting factors can increase hostility on campus (Hurtado, 2007). Thus, we included the task of rating of a single course relates to the larger campus along the dimensions of belonging and bias/discrimination. For example, if a single class has higher ratings on issues of inclusivity, diversity, and respect, we would expect that sentiment to be echoed in the broader institution. Our design has notable limitations You will likely notice that we ask about demographic characteristics of the instructional staff and classmates in the course rated, but we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent. In making this decision, we likely lose important information; Iacovino and James (2016) have noted that White students perceive campus more favorably than Black student counterparts. We made this decision to protect the identity of the respondent. As you will see when we download the data, if a faculty member asked an entire class to take the survey, the datestamp and a handful of demographic identifiers could very likely identify a student. In certain circumstances, this might be risky in that private information (i.e., gender nonconformity, disclosure of a disability) or course evaluation data could be related back to the student. Further, the items that ask respondents to guess the identities of the instructional staff and classmates are limited, and contrary to best practices in survey construction that recommend providing the option of a write-in a response. After consulting with a diverse group of stakeholders and subject matter experts (and revising the response options numerous times) I have attempted to center anti-Black racism in the U.S. (Mosley et al., 2020, 2021; Singh, 2020). In fact, the display logic does not present the race items when the course is offered outside the U.S. There are only five options for race: biracial/multiracial, Black, non-Black person(s) of color, White, and I did not notice (intended to capture a color-blind response). One unintended negative consequence of this design is that the response options could contribute to colorism (Adames et al., 2021; Capielo Rosario et al., 2019). Another possibility is that the limited options may erase, or make invisible, other identities. At the time that I am writing the first draft of this chapter, the murder of six Asian American women in Atlanta has just occurred. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremeism has documented that while overall hate drimes dropped by 7% in 2020, anti-Asian hate crimes reported to the police in Americas largest cities increasedby 149% (FACT SHEET, n.d.). These incidents have occurred not only in cities, but in our neighborhoods and on our campusus (P. Kim, 2021; Paul Y. Kim, 2021; STOP AAPI HATE, n.d.). While this survey is intended to assess campus climate as a function of race, it unfortunately does not distinguish between many identities that experience marginalization. In parallel, the items asking respondents to identity characteristics of the instructional staff along dimensions of gender, international status, and disability are large buckets and do not include write-in options. Similarly, there was no intent to cause harm by erasing or making invisible individuals whose identities are better defined by different descriptors. Further, no write-in items were allowed. This was also intentional to prevent potential harm caused by people who could leave inappropriate or harmful comments. 2.4.3 The Codebook In order to scrub-and-score a survey, it is critical to know about its content, scoring directions for scales/subscales, and its design. A more complete description of the survey design elements is (or will be) available in the Recentering Psych Stats: Psychometric OER. The review in this chapter provides just-enough information to allow us to make decisions about which items to retain and how to score them. When they are well-written, information in the IRB application and pre-registration can be helpful in the scrubbing and scoring process. Lets look live at the survey. In Qualtrics it is possible to print a PDF that looks very similar to its presentation when someone is taking it. You can access that static version here. We can export a codebook, that is, a Word (or PDF) version of the survey with all the coding. In Qualtrics the protocol is: Survey/Tools/ImportExport/Export Survey to Word. Then select all the options you want (especially Show Coded Values). A tutorial provided by Qualtrics can be found here. This same process can be used to print the PDF example I used above. It is almost impossible to give this lecture without some reference to Qualtrics and the features used in Qualtrics. An import of raw data from Qualtrics into R can be nightmare in that the Qualtrics-assigned variable names are numbers (e.g., QID1, QID2)  but often out of order because the number is assigned when the question is first created. If the survey is reordered, the numbers get out of sequence. Similarly, values for Likert-type scales can also get out of order if the scale anchors are revised (which is common to do). I recommend providing custom variable names and recode values directly in Qualtrics before exporting them into R. A Qualtrics tutorial for this is provided here. In general, consider these qualities when creating variable names: Brevity: historically, SPSS variable names could be a maximum of 8 characters. Intuitive: although variables can be renamed in R (e.g., for use in charts and tables), it is helpful when the name imported from Qualtrics provides some indication of what the variable is. Systematic: start items in a scale with the same stem, followed by the item number  ITEM1, ITEM2, ITEM3. The Rate-a-Recent-Course survey was written using some special features in Qualtrics. These include Display logic Items that are U.S.-centric are only shown if the respondent is taking a course from an institution in the U.S. is a student in the U.S. Loop and merge Because course may have multiple instructional staff, the information asking about demographic characteristics of the instructors is repeated according to the number input by the respondent Random presentation of the 30 items asking about campus climate for the five groups of students Although this might increase the cognitive load of the survey, this helps spread out missingness for respondents who might tire of the survey and stop early Rank ordering of the institutional level (department, school/faculty, campus/university) to which the respondent feels most connected Looking at the QTRX_df, StartDate thru UserLanguage are metadata created by Qualtrics. The remaining variables and associated value labels are in the codebook. 2.5 Scrubbing With a look at our survey, codebook, and imported data, we now get to the business of scRubbing (deleting those who did not give consent, deleting previews, etc.). This level of scrubbing precedes the more formal detection of outliers. 2.5.1 Tools for Data Manipulations The next stages will provide some experience manipulating data with dplyr from the tidyverse. The tidyverse is a system of packages (i.e,. when you download the tidyverse, you download all its packages/members) for data manipulation, exploration and visualization. The packages in the tidyverse share a common design philosophy. These were mostly developed by Hadley Wickham, but more recently, more designers are contributing to them. Tidyverse packages are intended to make statisticians and data scientists more productive by guiding them through workflows that facilitate communication and result in reproducible work products. Fundamentally, the tidyverse is about the connections between the tools that make the workflow possible. Critical packages in the tidyverse include: dplyr: data manipulation: mutate, select, filter, summarize, arrange ggplot2: extravagant graphing tibble: a tibble is a dataframe that provides the user with more (and less) control over the data. readr: gives access to rectangular data like .csv and tables tidyr: tidy data is where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, each value is a cell (duh). tidyrs contributions are gather(wide to long) and spread(long to wide) as well as separate, extract, unite. purrr: facilitates working with functions and vectors. For example, if you write a function, using purrr may help you replace loops with code that is more efficient and intuitive. The tidyverse is ever-evolving  so check frequently for updates and troubleshooting. A handy cheatsheet for data transformation is found here. 2.5.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria For me, the first pass at scrubbing is to eliminate the obvious. In our case this is includes previews and respondents who did not consent to continue. Previews are the researcher-initiated responses usually designed to proofread or troubleshoot survey problems. There could be other first-pass-deletions, such as selecting response between certain dates. I think these first-pass deletions, especially the ones around consent, are important to do as soon as possible. Otherwise, we might delete some of the variables (e.g., timestamps, consent documentation, preview status) and neglect to delete these cases later in the process. We are here in the workflow: An image of a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. We can either update the existing df (by using the same object), or creating a new df from the old. Either works. In my early years, I tended to create lots of new objects. As I have gained confidence in myself and in R, Im inclined to update the existing df. Why? Because unless you write the object as an outfile (using the same name for the object as for the filename  which I do not recommend), the object used in R does not change the source of the dat. Therefore, it is easy to correct early code and it keeps the global environment less cluttered. In this particular survey, the majority of respondents will take the survey because they clicked an anonymous link provided by Qualtrics. Another Qualtrics distribution method is e-mail. At the time of this writing, we have not recruited by e-mail, but it is is possible we could do so in the future. What we should not include, though, are previews. These are the times when the researcher is self-piloting the survey to look for errors and to troubleshoot. # the filter command is used when we are making inclusion/exclusion decisions about rows # != means do not include cases with &quot;preview&quot; library(tidyverse) QTRX_df &lt;- filter (QTRX_df, DistributionChannel != &quot;preview&quot;) #FYI, another way that doesn&#39;t use tidyverse, but gets the same result #QTRX_df &lt;- QTRX_df[!QTRX_df$DistributionChannel == &quot;preview&quot;,] APA Style, and in particular the Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) for quantitative research specify that we should report the frequency or percentages of missing data. We would start our counting after eliminating the previews. # I created an object that lists how many rows/cases remain. # I used inline text below to update the text with the new number attempts &lt;- nrow(QTRX_df) attempts ## [1] 52 CAPTURING RESULTS FOR WRITING IT UP: Data screening suggested that 52 individuals opened the survey link. Next lets filter in only those who consented to take the survey. Because Qualtrics discontinued the survey for everyone who did not consent, we do not have to worry that their data is unintentionally included, but it can be useful to mention the number of non-consenters in the summary of missing data. # == are used QTRX_df &lt;-(filter (QTRX_df, Consent == 1)) consented_attempts &lt;- nrow(QTRX_df) consented_attempts ## [1] 44 CAPTURING RESULTS FOR WRITING IT UP: Data screening suggested that 52 individuals opened the survey link. Of those, 44, granted consent and proceeded into the survey items. In this particular study, the categories used to collect race were U.S.-centric. Thus, they were only shown if the respondent indicated that the course being rated was taught by an institution in the U.S. Therefore, an an additional inclusion criteria for this specific research model should be that the course was taught in the U.S. QTRX_df &lt;-(filter (QTRX_df, USinst == 0)) US_inclusion &lt;- nrow(QTRX_df) US_inclusion ## [1] 38 CAPTURING RESULTS FOR WRITING IT UP: Data screening suggested that 52 individuals opened the survey link. Of those, 44, granted consent and proceeded into the survey items. A further inclusion criteria was that the course was taught in the U.S; 38 met this criteria. 2.5.3 Renaming Variables Even though we renamed the variables in Qualtrics, the loop-and-merge variables were auto-renamed such that they each started with a number. I cannot see how to rename these from inside Qualtrics. A potential problem is that, in R, when variable names start with numbers, they need to be surrounded with single quotation marks. I find it easier to rename them now. I used i to start the variable name to represent instructor. The form of the rename() function is this: df_named &lt;- rename(df_raw, NewName1 = OldName1) library(tidyverse) QTRX_df &lt;- rename(QTRX_df, iRace1 = &#39;1_iRace&#39;, iRace2 = &#39;2_iRace&#39;, iRace3 = &#39;3_iRace&#39;, iRace4 = &#39;4_iRace&#39;, iRace5 = &#39;5_iRace&#39;, iRace6 = &#39;6_iRace&#39;, iRace7 = &#39;7_iRace&#39;, iRace8 = &#39;8_iRace&#39;, iRace9 = &#39;9_iRace&#39;, iRace10 = &#39;10_iRace&#39;) Also in Qualtrics, it was not possible to rename the variable (formatted with sliders) that asked respondents to estimate the proportion of classmates in each race-based category. Using the codebook, we can do this now. I will use cm to precede each variable name to represent classmates. QTRX_df &lt;- rename(QTRX_df, cmBiMulti = Race_10, cmBlack = Race_1, cmNBPoC = Race_7, cmWhite = Race_8, cmUnsure = Race_2) Lets also create an ID variable (different from the lengthy Qualtrics-issued ID) and then move it to the front of the distribution. QTRX_df &lt;- QTRX_df %&gt;% mutate(ID = row_number()) #moving the ID number to the first column; requires QTRX_df &lt;- QTRX_df%&gt;%select(ID, everything()) 2.5.4 Downsizing the Dataframe Although researchers may differ in their approach, my tendency is to downsize the df to the variables I will be using in my study. These could include variables in the model, demographic variables, and potentially auxiliary variables (i.e,. variables not in the model, but that might be used in the case of multiple imputation). This particular survey did not collect demographic information, so that will not be used. The model that I will demonstrate in this research vignette examines the the respondents perceived campus climate for students who are Black, predicted by the the respondents own campus belonging, and also the structural diversity (K. R. Lewis &amp; Shah, 2019) proportions of Black students in the classroom and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) instructional staff. I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the %Black instructional staff. At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the staff to model this. The select() function can let us list the variables we want to retain. #You can use the &quot;:&quot; to include all variables from the first to last variable in any sequence; I could have written this more efficiently. I just like to &quot;see&quot; my scales and clusters of variables. Model_df &lt;-(select (QTRX_df, ID, iRace1, iRace2, iRace3, iRace4, iRace5, iRace6, iRace7, iRace8, iRace9, iRace10, cmBiMulti, cmBlack, cmNBPoC, cmWhite, cmUnsure, Belong_1:Belong_3, Blst_1:Blst_6)) It can be helpful to save outfile of progress as we go along. Here I save this raw file. write.table(Model_df, file=&quot;BlackStntsModel210318.csv&quot;, sep=&quot;,&quot;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) 2.6 Toward the APA Style Write-up 2.6.1 Method/Procedure Data screening suggested that 52 individuals opened the survey link. Of those, 44 granted consent and proceeded to the survey items. A further inclusion criteria was that the course was taught in the U.S; 38 met this criteria. 2.7 Practice Problems Starting with this chapter, the practice problems for this and the next two chapters (i.e., Scoring, Data Dx) are connected. Whatever practice option(s) you choose, please (a) use raw data that (b) has some data missing. This second criteria will be important in the subsequent chapters. The three problems below are listed in the order of graded complexity. If you are just getting started, you may wish to start with the first problem. If you are more confident, choose the second or third option. You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis. 2.7.1 Problem #1: Rework the Chapter Problem Because the Rate-a-Recent-Course survey remains open, it is quite likely that there will be more participants who have taken the survey since this chapter was last updated. If not  please encourage a peer to take it. Even one additional response will change the results. This practice problem encourages you to rework the chapter, as written, with the updated data from the survey. Assignment Component Points Possible Points Earned 1.

Work through the chapter making decisions that are consistent with the research model you have proposed. There will likely be differences at several points in the process. For example, you may wish to include (not exclude) data where the rated-course was offered by an institution outside the U.S. Different decisions may involve an internet search for the R script you will need as you decide on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

It is is also possible to download the Qualtrics data in a variety of formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, SPSS). Since I got started using files with the CSV extension (think Excel lite), that is my preference. In Qualtrics, these are the steps to download the data: Projects/YOURsurvey/Data &amp; Analysis/Export &amp; Import/Export data/CSV/Use numeric values I think that it is critical that to save this file in the same folder as the .rmd file that you will use with the data. R is sensitive to characters used filenames As downloaded, my Qualtrics .csv file had a long name with spaces and symbols that are not allowed. Therore, I gave it a simple, sensible, filename, ReC_Download210319.csv. An idiosyncracy of mine is to datestamp filenames. I use two-digit representations of the year, month, and date so that if the letters preceding the date are the same, the files would alphabetize automatically. library(qualtRics) QTRX_csv &lt;- read_survey(&quot;ReC_Download210319.csv&quot;, strip_html = TRUE, import_id = FALSE, time_zone=NULL, legacy = FALSE) ## ## -- Column specification -------------------------------------------------------- ## cols( ## .default = col_double(), ## StartDate = col_datetime(format = &quot;&quot;), ## EndDate = col_datetime(format = &quot;&quot;), ## RecordedDate = col_datetime(format = &quot;&quot;), ## ResponseId = col_character(), ## DistributionChannel = col_character(), ## UserLanguage = col_character(), ## Virtual = col_number(), ## `5_iPronouns` = col_logical(), ## `5_iGenderConf` = col_logical(), ## `5_iRace` = col_logical(), ## `5_iUS` = col_logical(), ## `5_iDis` = col_logical(), ## `6_iPronouns` = col_logical(), ## `6_iGenderConf` = col_logical(), ## `6_iRace` = col_logical(), ## `6_iUS` = col_logical(), ## `6_iDis` = col_logical(), ## `7_iPronouns` = col_logical(), ## `7_iGenderConf` = col_logical(), ## `7_iRace` = col_logical() ## # ... with 17 more columns ## ) ## i Use `spec()` for the full column specifications.

We continue with the raw data we downloaded and prepared in the prior chapter. In this chapter we analyze and manage missingness, score scales/subscales, and represent our work with an APA-style write-up. To that end, we will address the conceptual considerations and practical steps in this process. 3.1 Navigating this Lesson There is about 1 hour and 20 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be good to add another hour. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OERs introduction 3.1.1 Learning Objectives Learning objectives from this lecture include the following: Recognize the key components of data loss mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), including how to diagnose MCAR. Interpret missingness figures produced by packages such as mice. Articulate a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. Use critical data manipulation functions from dplyr including filter(), select(), and mutate() to prepare variables. Interpret code related to missingness (i.e., is.na, !is.na) and the pipe (%&gt;%) 3.1.2 Planning for Practice The suggestions for practice continue from the prior chapter. The assignment in the prior chapter involved downloading a dataset from Qualtrics and the scrubbing it on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using that same data, the practice suggestions in this chapter will continue to use Parents (2013) AIA approach to managing missing data, to score the variables of interest. Options of graded complexity could incude: Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written. Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose. Begin with raw data to which you have access. 3.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s).

The same workflow guides us through the Scrubbing, Scoring, and Data dx chapters. At this stage in the chapter we are still scrubbing as we work through the item-level and whole-level portions of the AIA (left side) of the chart. An image of our stage in the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. 3.3 Research Vignette The research vignette comes from the survey titled, Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise and is explained in the prior chapter. In the prior chapter we conducted super-preliminary scrubbing of variables that will allow us to examine the respondents perceived campus climate for students who are Black, predicted by the the respondents own campus belonging, and also the structural diversity proportions of Black students in the classroom and the BIPOC instructional staff. At present, I see this as a parallel mediation. That is, the perceived campus climate for Black students will be predicted by the respondents sense of belonging, through the proportion of Black classmates and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color)instructional staff. I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the %Black instructional staff. At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the staff to model this. An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data. First, though, lets take a more conceptual look at issues regarding missing data. Well come back to details of the survey as we work with it. 3.4 On Missing Data On the topic of missing data, we follow the traditions in most textbooks. We start by considering data loss mechanisms and options for managing missingness. Although the workflow I recommend is fairly straightforward, the topic is not. Quantitative psychologist have produced volumes of research that supports and refutes all of these issues in detail. An in-deth review of this is found in Enders (2010) text. 3.4.1 Data Loss Mechanisms We generally classify missingess in data in three different ways (Kline, 2016; Parent, 2013): Missing completely at random (MCAR) is the ideal case (and often unrealistic in actual data). For variable Y this mean that Missingness is due to a factor(s) completely unrelated to the missing data. Stated another way: Missing observations differ from the observed scores only by chance; that is, whether scores on Y are missing or not missing is unrelated to Y itself The presence versus absence of data on Y is unrelated to all other variables in the dataset. That is, the nonmissing data are just a random sample of scores that the researcher would have analyzed had the data been complete. We might think of it as haphazard missing. A respondent is interrupted, looks up, looks down, and skips an item. A computer glitch causes spotty missingness  unrelated to any particular variable. MCAR is the ideal state because results from it should not be biased as a function of the missingness. Missing at random (MAR) missing data arise from a process that is both measured and predictable in a particular sample. Admittedly the use of random in this term is odd, because, by definition, the missingness is not random. Restated: Missingness on Y is unrelated to Y itself, but Missingness is on Y is correlated with other variables in the data set. Example: Men are less likely to respond to questions about mental health than women, but among men, the probability of responding is unrelated to their true mental health status. Kline (2016) indicated that information loss due to MAR is potentially recoverable through imputation where missing scores are replaced by predicted scores. The predicted scores are generated from other variables in the data set that predict missingness on Y. If the strength of that prediction is reasonably strong, then results on Y after imputation may be relatively unbiased. In this sense, the MAR pattern is described as ignorable with regard to potential bias. Two types of variables can be used to predict the missing data variables that are in the prediction equation, and auxiliary variables (i.e., variables in the dataset that are not in the prediction equation). Parent (2013) noted that multiple imputation and expectation maximization have frequently been used to manage missingness in MAR circumstances. Missing not at random (MNAR) is when the presence versus absence of scores on Y depend on Y itself. This is non-ignorable. For example, if a patient drops out of a medical RCT because there are unpleasant side effects from the treatment, this discomfort is not measured, but the data is missing due to a process that is unknown in a particular data set. Results based on complete cases only can be severely biased when the data loss pattern is MNAR. That is, a treatment may look more beneficial than it really is if data from patients who were unable to tolerate the treatment are lost. Parent (2013) described MNAR a little differently  but emphasized that the systematic missingness would be related to a variable outside the datset. Parent provided the example of items written in a manner that may be inappropriate for some participants (e.g., asking women about a relationship with their boyfriend/husband, when the woman might be in same gender relationship). If there were not demographic items that could identify the bias, this would be MNAR. Parent strongly advises researchers to carefully proofread and pilot surveys to avoid MNAR circumstances. Kline (2016) noted that the choice of the method to deal with the incomplete records can make a difference in the results, and should be made carefully. 3.4.2 Diagnosing Missing Data Mechanisms The bad news is that we never really know (with certainty) the type of missing data mechanism in our data. The following tools can help understand the mechanisms that contribute to missingness. Missing data analyses often includes correlations that could predict missingness. Little and Rubin (2002) proposed a multivariate statistical test of the MCAR assumption that simultaneously compares complete versus incomplete cases on Y across all other variables. If this comparison is significant, then the MCAR hypothesis is rejected. To restate: we want a non-significant result; and we use the sometimes-backwards-sounding NHST (null hypothesis significance testing) language, MCAR cannot be rejected. MCAR can also be examined through a series of t tests of the cases that have missing scores on Y with cases that have complete records on other variables. Unfortunately, sample sizes contribute to problems with interpretation. With low samples, they are underpowered; in large samples they can flag trivial differences. If MCAR is rejected, we are never sure whether the data loss mechanism is MAR or MNAR. There is no magical statistical fix. Kline (2016) wrote, About the best that can be done is to understand the nature of the underlying data loss pattern and accordingly modify your interpretation of the results (p. 85). 3.4.3 Managing Missing Data There are a number of approaches to managing missing data. Here is a summary of the ones most commonly used. Listwise deletion (aka, Complete Case Analysis) If there is a missing score on any variable, that case is excluded from all analyses. Pairwise deletion Cases are excluded only if they have missing data on variables involved in a particular analysis. AIA is a variant of pair-wise deletion, but it preserves as much data as possible with person-mean imputation at the scale level. Mean/median substitution Mean/median substitution replaces missing values with the mean/median of that particular variable. While this preserves the mean of the dataset, it can cause bias by decreasing variance. For example, if you have a column that has substantial of missingness and you replace each value with the same, fixed, mean, the variability of that variable has just been reduced. A variation on this is a group-mean substitution where the missing score in a particular group (e.g., women) is replaced by the group mean. Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) A model-based method that takes the researchers model as the starting point. The procedure partitions the cases in a raw data file into subsets, each with the same pattern of missing observations, including none (complete cases). Statistical information (e.g., means, variances) is extracted from each subset so all case are retained in the analysis. Parameters for the researchers model are estimated after combining all available information over the subsets of cases. Multiple imputation A data based method that works with the whole raw data file (not just with the observed variables that comprise the researchers model). Multiple imputation assumes that data are MAR (remember, MCAR is the more prestigious one). This means that researchers assume that missing values can be replaced by predictions derived from the observable portion fo the dataset. Multiple datasets (often 5 to 20) are created where missing values are replaced via a randomized process (so the same missing value [item 4 for person A] will likely have different values for each dataset). The desired anlayis(es) is conducted simultaneously/separately for each of the imputed sets (so if you imputed 5 sets and wanted a linear regression, you get 5 linear regressions). A pooled analysis uses the point estimates and the standard errors to provide a single result that represents the analysis. 3.4.4 Available Information Analysis (AIA) Parent (2013) has created a set of recommendations that help us create a streamlined workflow for managing missing data. After evaluating three approaches to managing missingness (AIA, mean substitution, and multiple imputation) Parent concluded that in datasets with (a) low levels of missingness, (b) a reasonable sample size, and (c) adequate internal reliability of measures, these approaches had similar results. Further, in simulation studies where there was (a) low sample size (n = 50), (b) weak associations among items, and (c) a small number of missing items, AIA was equivalent to multiple imputation. Even in cases where the data conditions were the best (i.e., N = 200, moderate correlations, at least 10 items), even 10% missingness (overall) did not produce notable difference among the methods. That is, means, standard errors, and alphas were similar across the methods (AIA, mean substitution, multiple imputation). AIA is an older method of handling missing data that, as its name suggests, uses the available data for analysis and excludes missing data points only for analyses in which the missing data point would be directly involved. This means In the case of research that uses multiple item scales, and analysis takes place at the scale level AIA is used to generate mean scores for the scale using the available data without substituting or imputing values; This method generally produces a fairly complete set of scale-level data where pairwise deletion (the whole row/case/person is skipped) can be used where there will be multiple analyses using statistics (e.g., correlations, t-tests, ANOVA) were missingness is not permitted FIML can be specified in path analysisand CFA/SEM (where item-level data is required), and some statistics, such as principal components analysis and principal axis factoring (item-level analyses) permit missing data, Of course, the researcher could still impute data, but why Parents (2013) recommendations: Scale scores should be first calculated as a mean (average) not a sum. Why? Calculating a sum from available data will result in automatically lower scores in cases where there is missingness. If a sum is required (i.e., because you want to interpret some clinical level of something), calculate the mean first, do the analyses, then transform the results back into the whole-scale equivalent (multiply the mean by the number of items) for any interpretation. For R script, do not write the script ([item1 + item2 + item3]/3) because this will return an empty entry for participants missing data (same problem as if you were to use sum). There are several functions for properly computing a mean; I will demo the mean_n() function from sjstats package because it allows us to simultaneously specify the tolerance level (next item). Determine your tolerance for missingness (20% seems to be common, although you could also look for guidance in the test manual/article). Then Run a percent missingness check on the level of analysis (i.e., total score, scale, or subscale) you are using. If you are using a total scale score, then check to see what percent is missing across all the items in the whole scale. In contrast, if you are looking at subscales, run the percent missing at that level. Parent (2013) advised that the tolerance levels should be made mindfully. A four-item scale with one item missing, wont meet the 80% threshold, so it may make sense to set a 75% threshold for this scale. Clearly and concisely detail the level of missingness in papers (Parent, 2013, p. 595). This includes tolerance level for missing data by scale or subscale (e.g., 80% or 75%) the number of missing values out of all data points on that scale for all participants and the maximum by participant (e.g., For Scale X, a total of # missing data points out of ### were observed with no participant missing more than a single point.) verify a manual inspection of missing data for obvious patterns (e.g., abnormally high missing rates for only one or two items). This can be accomplished by requesting frequency output for the items and checking the nonmissing data points for each scale, ensuring there are no abnormal spikes in missingness (looking for MNAR). Curiously, Parent (2013) does not recommend that we run all the diagnostic tests. However, because recent reviewers have required them of me, I will demonstrate a series of them. Reducing missingness starts at the survey design  make sure that all people can answer all items (i.e,. relationship-related items may contain heterosexist assumptionswhich would result in an MNAR circumstance) Very practically speaking, Parents (2013) recommendations follow us through the entire data analysis process. 3.5 Working the Problem In the prior chapter we imported the data from Qualtrics and applied the broadest levels of inclusion (e.g., the course rated was offered from an institution in the U.S., the respondent consented to participation) and exclusion (e.g., the survey was not a preview). We then downsized the survey to include the variables we will use in our statistical model. We then saved the data in a .csv file. Presuming that you are working along with me in an .rmd file, if you have placed that file in the same folder as this .rmd file, the following code should read the data into your environment. I use different names for the object/df in my R environment than I use for the filename that holds the data on my computer. Why? I dont want to accidentally overwrite this precious source of data. scrub_df &lt;- read.csv (&quot;BlackStntsModel210318.csv&quot;, head = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;) str(scrub_df) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 38 obs. of 25 variables: ## $ ID : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ iRace1 : int 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 1 0 ... ## $ iRace2 : int 1 NA 1 1 NA NA 3 NA NA 0 ... ## $ iRace3 : int 3 NA NA 3 NA NA NA NA NA 3 ... ## $ iRace4 : int NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 3 ... ## $ iRace5 : logi NA NA NA NA NA NA ... ## $ iRace6 : logi NA NA NA NA NA NA ... ## $ iRace7 : logi NA NA NA NA NA NA ... ## $ iRace8 : logi NA NA NA NA NA NA ... ## $ iRace9 : logi NA NA NA NA NA NA ... ## $ iRace10 : logi NA NA NA NA NA NA ... ## $ cmBiMulti: int 0 0 0 2 5 15 0 0 0 7 ... ## $ cmBlack : int 0 5 10 6 5 20 0 0 0 4 ... ## $ cmNBPoC : int 39 10 30 19 10 30 40 5 30 13 ... ## $ cmWhite : int 61 85 60 73 80 35 60 90 70 73 ... ## $ cmUnsure : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 3 ... ## $ Belong_1 : int 6 4 NA 5 4 5 6 7 6 3 ... ## $ Belong_2 : int 6 4 3 3 4 6 6 7 6 3 ... ## $ Belong_3 : int 7 6 NA 2 4 5 5 7 6 3 ... ## $ Blst_1 : int 5 6 NA 2 6 5 5 5 5 3 ... ## $ Blst_2 : int 3 6 5 2 1 1 4 4 3 5 ... ## $ Blst_3 : int 5 2 2 2 1 1 4 3 1 2 ... ## $ Blst_4 : int 2 2 2 2 1 2 4 3 2 3 ... ## $ Blst_5 : int 2 4 NA 2 1 1 4 4 1 3 ... ## $ Blst_6 : int 2 1 2 2 1 2 4 3 2 3 ... Lets think about how the variables in our model should be measured: DV: Campus Climate for Black Students (as perceived by the respondent) mean score of the 6 items on that scale (higher scores indicate a climate characterized by hostility, nonresponsiveness, and stigma) 1 item needs to be reverse-coded this scale was adapted from the LGBT Campus Climate Scale (Szymanski &amp; Bissonette, 2020) IV: Belonging mean score for the 3 items on that scale (higher scores indicate a greater sense of belonging) this scale is taken from the Sense of Belonging subscale from the Perceived Cohesion Scale (Bollen &amp; Hoyle, 1990) Proportion of classmates who are Black a single item Proportion of instructional staff who are BIPOC must be calculated from each of the single items for each instructor Our next step is to conduct a preliminary missing data analysis at the item level, across the dataset we are using. The Campus Climate and Belonging scales are traditional in the sense that they have items that we sum. The variable representing proportion of classmates who are Black is a single item. The variable representing the proportion of instructional staff who are BIPOC must be calculated in a manner that takes into consideration the there may be multiple instructors. The survey allowed a respondent to name up to 10 instructors. str(scrub_df$iRace1) ## int [1:38] 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 1 0 ... Looking at the structure of our data, the iRace(1 thru 10) variables are in int or integer format. This means that they are represented as whole numbers. We need them to be represented as factors. R handles factors represented as words well. Therefore, lets use our codebook to reformat this variable as a an ordered factor, with words instead of numbers. Qualtrics imports many of the categorical variables as numbers. R often reads them numerically (integers or numbers). If they are directly converted to factors, R will sometimes collapse across missing numbers. In this example, if there is a race that is not represented (e.g., 2 for BiMulti), when the numbers are changed to factors, R will assume they are ordered and there is a consecutive series of numbers (0,1,2,3,4). If a number in the sequence is missing (0,1,3,4) and labels are applied, it will collapse across the numbers and the labels you think are attached to each number are not. Therefore, it is ESSENTIAL to check (again and again ad nauseum) to ensure that your variables are recoding in a manner you understand. One way to avoid this is to use the code below to identify the levels and the labels. When they are in order, they align and dont skip numbers. To quadruple check our work, we will recode into a new variable tRace# for teacher Race. scrub_df$tRace1 = factor(scrub_df$iRace1, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) scrub_df$tRace2 = factor(scrub_df$iRace2, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) scrub_df$tRace3 = factor(scrub_df$iRace3, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) scrub_df$tRace4 = factor(scrub_df$iRace4, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) scrub_df$tRace5 = factor(scrub_df$iRace5, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) scrub_df$tRace6 = factor(scrub_df$iRace6, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) scrub_df$tRace7 = factor(scrub_df$iRace7, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) scrub_df$tRace8 = factor(scrub_df$iRace8, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) scrub_df$tRace9 = factor(scrub_df$iRace9, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) scrub_df$tRace10 = factor(scrub_df$iRace10, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) Lets check the structure to see if they are factors. library(tidyverse) glimpse(scrub_df) ## Rows: 38 ## Columns: 35 ## $ ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17... ## $ iRace1 &lt;int&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, ... ## $ iRace2 &lt;int&gt; 1, NA, 1, 1, NA, NA, 3, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 3, NA, 3, 3, N... ## $ iRace3 &lt;int&gt; 3, NA, NA, 3, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 3, NA, NA, NA, NA, 3, 1... ## $ iRace4 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 3, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA... ## $ iRace5 &lt;lgl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ iRace6 &lt;lgl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ iRace7 &lt;lgl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ iRace8 &lt;lgl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ iRace9 &lt;lgl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ iRace10 &lt;lgl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ cmBiMulti &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 15, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 20, 0, 9, 12, 0, 6, ... ## $ cmBlack &lt;int&gt; 0, 5, 10, 6, 5, 20, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 6, 9, 1, 21, 5, ... ## $ cmNBPoC &lt;int&gt; 39, 10, 30, 19, 10, 30, 40, 5, 30, 13, 80, 19, 0, 19, 15,... ## $ cmWhite &lt;int&gt; 61, 85, 60, 73, 80, 35, 60, 90, 70, 73, 10, 74, 80, 0, 67... ## $ cmUnsure &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 3, 10, 0, 0, 75, 0, 14, 0, 5, ... ## $ Belong_1 &lt;int&gt; 6, 4, NA, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 5, 1,... ## $ Belong_2 &lt;int&gt; 6, 4, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 6, 3, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 4, 6, 1, ... ## $ Belong_3 &lt;int&gt; 7, 6, NA, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7, 6, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1,... ## $ Blst_1 &lt;int&gt; 5, 6, NA, 2, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, NA, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 6, 4, 4... ## $ Blst_2 &lt;int&gt; 3, 6, 5, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 3, 5, NA, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 5,... ## $ Blst_3 &lt;int&gt; 5, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 2, 2, ... ## $ Blst_4 &lt;int&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, NA, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2,... ## $ Blst_5 &lt;int&gt; 2, 4, NA, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2,... ## $ Blst_6 &lt;int&gt; 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, NA, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2,... ## $ tRace1 &lt;fct&gt; White, White, White, White, nBpoc, White, White, White, n... ## $ tRace2 &lt;fct&gt; nBpoc, NA, nBpoc, nBpoc, NA, NA, White, NA, NA, Black, NA... ## $ tRace3 &lt;fct&gt; White, NA, NA, White, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, White, NA, NA, ... ## $ tRace4 &lt;fct&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, White, NA, NA, NA, NA... ## $ tRace5 &lt;fct&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ tRace6 &lt;fct&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ tRace7 &lt;fct&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ tRace8 &lt;fct&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ tRace9 &lt;fct&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... ## $ tRace10 &lt;fct&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N... Calculating the proportion of the BIPOC instructional staff could likely be accomplished a number of ways. My searching for solutions resulted in this. Hopefully its a fair balance between intuitive and elegant coding. First, I created code that created a new variable (count.BIPOC) by summing across the tRace1 through tRace10 variables, assigning a count of 1 each time the factor value was Black, nBpoc, or BiMulti scrub_df$count.BIPOC &lt;- apply(scrub_df[c(&quot;tRace1&quot;, &quot;tRace2&quot;, &quot;tRace3&quot;, &quot;tRace4&quot;, &quot;tRace5&quot;, &quot;tRace6&quot;, &quot;tRace7&quot;, &quot;tRace8&quot;, &quot;tRace9&quot;, &quot;tRace10&quot;)], 1, function(x) sum(x %in% c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;))) Next, I created a variable that counted the number of non-missing values across the tRace1 through tRace10 variables. scrub_df$count.nMiss &lt;- apply(scrub_df[c(&quot;tRace1&quot;, &quot;tRace2&quot;, &quot;tRace3&quot;, &quot;tRace4&quot;, &quot;tRace5&quot;, &quot;tRace6&quot;, &quot;tRace7&quot;, &quot;tRace8&quot;, &quot;tRace9&quot;, &quot;tRace10&quot;)], 1, function(x) sum(!is.na(x))) Now to calculate the proportion of BIPOC instructional faculty for each case. scrub_df$iBIPOC_pr = scrub_df$count.BIPOC/scrub_df$count.nMiss 3.5.1 Missing Data Analysis: Whole df and Item level In understanding missingness across the dataset, I think it is important to analyze and manage it, iteratively. We will start with a view of the whole df-level missingness. Subsequently, and consistent with the available information analysis [AIA; Parent (2013)] approach, we will score the scales and then look again at missingness, using the new information to update our decisions about how to manage it. An image of our stage in the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. Because we just created a host of new variables in creating the prop_BIPOC variable, lets downsize the df so that the calculations are sensible. scrub_df &lt;-(select (scrub_df, ID, iBIPOC_pr, cmBlack, Belong_1:Belong_3, Blst_1:Blst_6)) With a couple of calculations, we create a proportion of item-level missingness. In this chunk I first calculate the number of missing (nmiss) #Calculating number and proportion of item-level missingness scrub_df$nmiss &lt;- scrub_df%&gt;% select(iBIPOC_pr:Blst_6) %&gt;% #the colon allows us to include all variables between the two listed (the variables need to be in order) is.na %&gt;% rowSums scrub_df&lt;- scrub_df%&gt;% mutate(prop_miss = (nmiss/11)*100) #11 is the number of variables included in calculating the proportion We can grab the descriptives for the prop_miss variable to begin to understand our data. I will create an object from it so I can use it with inline library(formattable) CaseMiss&lt;-psych::describe(scrub_df$prop_miss) CaseMiss ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis se ## X1 1 38 3.35 9.31 0 0.85 0 0 36.36 36.36 2.77 6.48 1.51 missMin &lt;- digits(CaseMiss$min, 0) missMax &lt;- digits(CaseMiss$max, 0) CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from 0% to 36%. At the time that I am lecturing this, the the amount of missing is not so egregious that I want to eliminate any cases. That is, Im willing to wait until after I score the items to make further decisions, then. Because (a) I want to teach it and (b) it is quite likely that we will receive responses with high levels of missingness, I will write code to eliminate cases with \\(\\geq\\) 90%. scrub_df &lt;- filter(scrub_df, prop_miss &lt;= 90) #update df to have only those with at least 90% of complete data To analyze missingness at this level, we need a df that has only the variables of interest. That is, variables like ID and the prop_miss and nmiss variables we created will interfere with an accurate assessment of missingness. I will update our df to eliminate these. scrub_df &lt;- scrub_df %&gt;% select (-c(ID, nmiss, prop_miss))#further update to exclude the n_miss and prop_miss variables Missing data analysis commonly looks at proportions by: the entire df rows/cases/people #install.packages(&quot;formattable&quot;) CellsMiss &lt;- percent(mean(is.na(scrub_df)))#what proportion of cells missing across entire dataset CaseComplete &lt;- percent(mean(complete.cases(scrub_df)))#what proportion of cases (rows) are complete (nonmissing) CellsMiss ## [1] 3.35% CaseComplete ## [1] 84.21% CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from 0% to 36%. Across the dataset, 3.35% of cells had missing data and 84.21% of cases had nonmissing data. 3.5.2 Analyzing Missing Data Patterns One approach to analyzing missing data is to assess patterns of missingness. Several R packages are popularly used for conducting such analyses. In the mice package, md.pattern() function provides a matrix with the number of columns + 1, in which each row corresponds to a missing data pattern (1 = observed, 0 = missing). Rows and columns are sorted in increasing amounts of missing information. The last column and row contain row and column counts, respectively. #Using the package: mice library(mice) mice_out &lt;- md.pattern(scrub_df, plot = TRUE, rotate.names = TRUE) mice_out write.csv (mice_out, file=&quot;mice_out.csv&quot;) #optional to write it to a .csv file The table lets you look at each missing pattern and see which variable(s) is/are missing. The output is in the form of a table that indicates the frequency of each pattern of missingness. Because I havent (yet) figured out how to pipe objects from this table into the chapter, this text may dier from the patterns in the current data frame. Each row in the table represents a different pattern of missingness. At the time of writing, there are 6 patterns of missing data. The patterns are listed in descending order of the least amount of missingness. The most common pattern (23 cases, top row) is one with no missing data. One cases (is missing three cells  three of the items assessing the campus climate for Black students, and so forth. These numbers are not piped and subject to change. In general, the data patterns represented a haphazard patterns of responding (Enders, 2010). 3.5.3 Missing Mechanisms Remember Littles MCAR test. Recently it has a history of appearing, working with glitches, disappearing, and so forth. At the present time I cannot find a package that is working well. When I do, I will add this section. 3.6 Scoring So lets get to work to score up the measures for our analysis. Each step of this should involve careful cross-checking with the codebook. 3.6.1 Reverse scoring As we discovered previously, in the scale that assesses campus climate (higher scores reflect a more negative climate) one of our items (Blst_1, My institution provides a supportive environment for Black students.) requires reverse-coding. To rescore: Create a new variable (this is essential) that is designated as the reversed item. We might put a the letter r (for reverse scoring) at the beginning or end: rBlst_1 or Blst_1r. It does not matter; just be consistent. We dont reverse score into the same variable because when you rerun the script, it just re-reverses the reversed scoreinto infinity. Its very easy to lose your place. The reversal is an equation where you subtract the value in the item from the range/scaling + 1. For the our three items we subtract each items value from 8. scrub_df&lt;- scrub_df %&gt;% mutate(rBlst_1 = 8 - Blst_1) #if you had multiple items, you could add a pipe (%&gt;%) at the end of the line and add more until the last one Per Parent (2013) we will analyze missingness for each scale, separately. We will calculate scale scores on each scale separately when 80% (roughly) of the data is present. this is somewhat arbitrary, on 4 item scales, I would choose 75% (to allow one to be missing) on the 3 item scale, I will allow one item to be missing (65%) After calculating the scale scores, we will return to analyzing the missingness, looking at the whole df The mean_n() function of sjstats package has allows you to specify how many items (whole number) or what percentage of items should be present in order to get the mean. First, though, we should identify the variables (properly formatted, if rescoring was needed) that should be included in the calculation of each scale and subscale. In our case, the scale assessing belonging (Bollen &amp; Hoyle, 1990; Hurtado &amp; Carter, 1997) involves three items with no reversals. Our campus climate scale was adapted from Szymanski et al.s LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale (Szymanski &amp; Bissonette, 2020). While it has not been psychometrically evaluated for the purpose for which I am using it, I will follow the scoring structure in the journal article that introduces the measure. Specifically, the factor structure permits a total scale score and two subscales representing the college response and stigma. library(sjstats) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;sjstats&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:psych&#39;: ## ## phi #Making the list of variables Belonging_vars &lt;- c(&#39;Belong_1&#39;,&#39;Belong_2&#39;,&#39;Belong_3&#39;) ResponseBL_vars &lt;- c(&#39;rBlst_1&#39;, &#39;Blst_4&#39;,&#39;Blst_6&#39;) StigmaBL_vars &lt;- c(&#39;Blst_2&#39;, &#39;Blst_3&#39;,&#39;Blst_5&#39;) ClimateBL_vars &lt;- c(&#39;rBlst_1&#39;, &#39;Blst_4&#39;,&#39;Blst_6&#39;,&#39;Blst_2&#39;, &#39;Blst_3&#39;,&#39;Blst_5&#39; ) #Creating the new variables scrub_df$Belonging &lt;- mean_n(scrub_df[,Belonging_vars], .65) scrub_df$ResponseBL &lt;- mean_n(scrub_df[,ResponseBL_vars], .80) scrub_df$StigmaBL &lt;- mean_n(scrub_df[,StigmaBL_vars], .80) scrub_df$ClimateBL &lt;- mean_n(scrub_df[,ClimateBL_vars], .80) Later it will be helpful to have a df with the item and scale-level variables. It will also be helpful if there is an ID for each case. library(tidyverse) scrub_df &lt;- scrub_df %&gt;% mutate(ID = row_number()) #moving the ID number to the first column; requires scrub_df &lt;- scrub_df%&gt;%select(ID, everything()) Lets save our scrub_df data for this and write it as an outfile. write.table(scrub_df, file=&quot;BlStItmsScrs210320.csv&quot;, sep=&quot;,&quot;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) 3.7 Missing Analysis: Scale level Lets return to analyzing the missingness, this time including the scale level variables (without the individual items) that will be in our statistical model(s). An image of our stage in the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. First lets get the df down to the variables we want to retain: scored &lt;-(select (scrub_df, iBIPOC_pr, cmBlack, Belonging, ResponseBL, StigmaBL, ClimateBL)) ScoredCaseMiss &lt;- nrow(scored) #I produced this object for the sole purpose of feeding the number of cases into the inline text, below Before we start our formal analysis of missingness at the scale level, lets continue to scrub by eliminating cases that clearly wont remain. In the script below we create a variable that counts the number of missing variables and then creates a proportion by dividing it by the number of total variables. Using the describe() function from the psych package, we can investigate this variable. library(psych) #Create a variable (n_miss) that counts the number missing scored$n_miss &lt;- scored%&gt;% select(iBIPOC_pr:ClimateBL) %&gt;% is.na %&gt;% rowSums #Create a proportion missing by dividing n_miss by the total number of variables (6) #Pipe to sort in order of descending frequency to get a sense of the missingness scored&lt;- scored%&gt;% mutate(prop_miss = (n_miss/6)*100)%&gt;% arrange(desc(n_miss)) ScoredPrMiss &lt;- psych::describe(scored$prop_miss) ScoredPrMiss ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis se ## X1 1 38 3.51 9.62 0 1.04 0 0 33.33 33.33 2.45 4.51 1.56 ScrdMissMin &lt;- digits(ScoredPrMiss$min, 0)#this object is displayed below and I use input from it for the inline text used in the write-up ScrdMissMax &lt;- digits(ScoredPrMiss$max, 0) ScrdMissMin ## [1] 0 ScrdMissMax ## [1] 33 CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across the 38 cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from 0% to 33%. We need to decide what is our retention threshhold. Twenty percent seems to be a general rule of thumb. Lets delete all cases with missingness at 20% or greater. scored &lt;- filter(scored, prop_miss &lt;= 20) #update df to have only those with at least 20% of complete data (this is an arbitrary decision) scored &lt;-(select (scored, iBIPOC_pr:ClimateBL)) #the variable selection just lops off the proportion missing ScoredCasesIncluded &lt;- nrow(scored) ScoredCasesIncluded #this object is displayed below and I use input from it for the inline text used in the write-up ## [1] 35 CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across the 38 cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from 0% to 33%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20% missing, the dataset analyzed included 35 cases. With a decision about the number of cases we are going to include, we can continue to analyze missingness. 3.8 Revisiting Missing Analysis at the Scale Level We work with a df that includes only the variables in our model. In our case this is easy. In other cases (i.e., maybe there is an ID number) it might be good to create a subset just for this analysis. Again, we look at missingness as the proportion of individual cells across the dataset, and rows/cases with nonmissing data PrScoredCellsMissing &lt;-percent(mean(is.na(scored))) #percent missing across df PrScoredRowsMissing &lt;- percent(mean(complete.cases(scored))) #percent of rows with nonmissing data PrScoredCellsMissing ## [1] 0.95% PrScoredRowsMissing ## [1] 94.29% CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR WRITING IT UP: Across the 38 cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from 0% to 33%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20% missing, the dataset analyzed included 35 cases. In this dataset we had 0.95% missing across the df; 94.29% of the rows had nonmissing data. Lets look again at missing patterns and mechanisms. 3.8.1 Scale Level: Patterns of Missing Data Returning to the mice package, we can use the md.pattern() function to examine a matrix with the number of columns + 1 in which each row corresponds to a missing data pattern (1 = observed, 0 = missing). The rows and columns are sorted in increasing amounts of missing information. The last column and row contain row and column counts, respectively. #Using the package: mice library(mice) mice_ScaleLvl &lt;- md.pattern(scored, plot = TRUE, rotate.names=TRUE) At the scale-level, this is much easier to interpret. As I am lecturing the results today (the numbers will change) there are 2 rows of data because there are only 2 patterns of missingness. The most common pattern is non-missing data (n = 26). 3.8.2 Is it MCAR? As noted earlier, I cannot find an MCAR package. This is a placeholder for updating this portion of the lecture when one becomes readily available (and I learn about it) 3.8.3 R-eady for Analysis At this stage the data is ready for analysis (data diagnostics). With the AIA approach (Parent, 2013) the following preliminary analyses would involve pairwise deletion (i.e., the row/case is dropped for that analysis, but included for all others): An image of our stage in the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. data diagnostics psychometric properties of scales, such as alpha coefficients assessing assumptions such as univariate and multivariate normality, outliers, etc. preliminary analyses descriptives (means/standard deviations, frequencies) correlation matrices AIA can also be used with primary analyses. Examples of how to manage missingness include: ANOVA/regression models if completed with ordinary least squares, pairwise deletion would be utilized SEM/CFA models with observed, latent, or hybrid models if FIML (well discuss later) is specified, all cases are used, even when there is missingness EFA models these can handle item-level missingness Hierarchical linear modeling/multilevel modeling/mixed effects modeling While all data needs to be present for a given cluster/wave, it is permissible to have varying numbers of clusters/waves per case 3.9 The APA Style Write-Up 3.10 Results All analyses were completed in R Studio (v. 1.4.1106) with R (v. 4.0.4). Missing Data Analysis and Treatment of Missing Data Available item analysis (AIA; (Parent, 2013)) is a strategy for managing missing data that uses available data for analysis and excludes cases with missing data points only for analyses in which the data points would be directly involved. Parent (2013) suggested that AIA is equivalent to more complex methods (e.g., multiple imputation) across a number of variations of sample size, magnitude of associations among items, and degree of missingness. Thus, we utilized Parents recommendations to guide our approach to managing missing data. Missing data analyses were conducted with tools in base R as well as the R packages, psych (v. 1.0.12) and mice (v. 3.13.0). Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from 0% to 36%. Across the dataset, 3.35% of cells had missing data and 84.21% of cases had nonmissing data. At this stage in the analysis, we allowed all cases with less than 90% missing to continue to the scoring stage. Guided by Parents (2013) AIA approach, scales with three items were scored if at least two items were non-missing; the scale with four items was scored if it at least three non-missing items; and the scale with six items was scored if it had at least five non-missing items. Across the 38 cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from 0% to 33%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20% missing, the dataset analyzed included 35 cases. In this dataset we had 0.95% missing across the df; 94.29% of the rows had nonmissing data. 3.11 Practice Problems The three problems described below are designed to be continuations from the previous chapter (Scrubbing).

We are asking the question, Does the data have the appropriate characteristics for the analysis we want to perform? Some statistics are more robust than others to violations of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data. None-the-less, we must report these characteristics when we disseminate the results. 4.1 Navigating this Lesson There is about 45 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional hour. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OERs introduction 4.1.1 Learning Objectives Learning objectives from this lecture include the following: Conduct and interpret critical data diagnostics, including alpha coefficients skew kurtosis Assess univariate and multivariate normality Identify options for managing outliers and skewed data Articulate a workflow for data preparation, including scrubbing, scoring, and data diagnostics 4.1.2 Planning for Practice The suggestions from practice are a continuation from the two prior chapters. If you have completed one or more of those assignments, you should have started with a raw dataset and then scrubbed and scored it. This chapter will involve running basic data diagnostics. Options of graded complexity could incude: Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written. Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose. Begin with raw data to which you have access. 4.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s).

At this stage we have imported our raw data from Qualtrics, scrubbed the data by applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, and used Parents available information approach [AIA; (2013)] for determining the acceptable amount of missingness for each scale, and prepared variables and scored them. We are now ready to engage in data diagnostics for the statistical model we will test. An image of our stage in the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. 4.3 Research Vignette The research vignette comes from the survey titled, Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise and is explained in the scrubbing chapter. In the scoring chapter we prepared four variables for analysis. Details for these are in our codebook. Variable recap: Perceived Campus Climate for Black Students includes 6 items, one of which was reverse scored. This scale was adapted from Szymanski et al.s (2020) Campus Climate for LGBTQ students. It has not been evaluated for use with other groups. The Szymanski et al. analysis suggested that it could be used as a total scale score, or divided into three items each that assess College response to LGBTQ students (items 6, 4, 1) LGBTQ stigma (items 3, 2, 5) Sense of Belonging includes 3 items. This is a subscale from Bollen and Hoyles (1990) Perceived Cohesion Scale. There are no items on this scale that require reversing. Percent of Black classmates is a single item that asked respondents to estimate the proportion of students in various racial categories Percent of BIPOC instructional staff, similarly, asked respondents to identify the racial category of each member of their instructional staff As we noted in the scrubbing chapter, our design has notable limitations. Briefly, (a) owing to the open source aspect of the data we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent; (b) the items that ask respondents to guess the identities of the instructional staff and to place them in broad categories, (c) we do not provide a write-in a response. We made these decisions after extensive conversation with stakeholders. The primary reason for these decisions was to prevent potential harm (a) to respondents who could be identified if/when the revealed private information in this open-source survey, and (b) trolls who would write inappropriate or harmful comments. As I think about how these variables go together (which is often where I start in planning a study), imagine a parallel mediation. That is the perception of campus climate for Black students would be predicted by the respondents sense of belonging, mediated in separate paths through the proportion of classmates who are Black and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff. I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the %Black instructional staff. At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the staff to model this. An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data. I will finish up this chapter by conducting a regression. Because parallel mediation can be complicated (I teach it in a later chapter), I will demonstrate use of our prepared variables with a simple multiple regression. An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data. First, though, lets take a more conceptual look at issues regarding missing data. Well come back to details of the survey as we work with it. 4.4 Internal Consistency of Scales/Subscales Alpha coefficients are reliability coefficients that assess the internal consistency of an instrument. It asks, For each person, are responses consistently high, or medium, or low? To the degree that they are (meaning there are high inter-item correlations), the internal consistency coefficient will be high. We want values &gt;.80. There are numerous problems with alpha coefficients. The biggest one is that they are influenced by sample size  longer scales have higher alpha coefficients (Cortina, 1993). Fourteen seems to be a magic number where we begin to not trust the high alpha coefficient. I address this more thoroughly  offering an alternative  in psychometrics. While there is much criticism about the usefulness of the alpha coefficient (Sijtsma, 2009), researchers continue to use the alpha coefficient as an indicator of the internal consistency of scales that consist of multiple items and contain several variables. We need item level data to compute an alpha coefficient. The easiest way to get an alpha coefficient is to feed the alpha() function (psych package) a contatonated list of items (with any items already reverse-scored). There should be no extra items. In the scoring chapter we already reverse-coded the single item in the campus climate scale, so we are ready to calculate alphas. The df from which I am pulling data was created and written as an outfile in the scoring chapter. This particular df has item-level data. item_scores_df &lt;- read.csv (&quot;BlStItmsScrs210320.csv&quot;, head = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;) From this, we create tiny dfs, one for each of the alpha coefficients we need to create.

Between the two subscales, it looks as if the responsivenes subscale is more internally consistent. 4.5 Distributional Characteristics of the Variables 4.5.1 Evaluating Univariate Normality Statistics like ANOVA and regression each have a set of assumptions about the distributional characteristics of the data. In most of the chapters in this OER we review those assumptions and how to evaluate them. Common across many statistics is the requirement of univariate and multivariate normality. Lets take a look at the variables we will use in our analysis and assess those. We can continue to work from the df we uploaded at the beginning of the chapter to do this work. Lets take a quick peek. This df has the item-level data (we used it for the alpha coefficients); the scale and subscale scores; and the two items that assess proportion of instructional staff that are BIPOC and proportion of classmates that are BIPOC. The str() function lets us look at the variable format/measurement level of each variable. str(item_scores_df) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 38 obs. of 17 variables: ## $ ID : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ iBIPOC_pr : num 0.333 0 0.5 0.333 1 ... ## $ cmBlack : int 0 5 10 6 5 20 0 0 0 4 ... ## $ Belong_1 : int 6 4 NA 5 4 5 6 7 6 3 ... ## $ Belong_2 : int 6 4 3 3 4 6 6 7 6 3 ... ## $ Belong_3 : int 7 6 NA 2 4 5 5 7 6 3 ... ## $ Blst_1 : int 5 6 NA 2 6 5 5 5 5 3 ... ## $ Blst_2 : int 3 6 5 2 1 1 4 4 3 5 ... ## $ Blst_3 : int 5 2 2 2 1 1 4 3 1 2 ... ## $ Blst_4 : int 2 2 2 2 1 2 4 3 2 3 ... ## $ Blst_5 : int 2 4 NA 2 1 1 4 4 1 3 ... ## $ Blst_6 : int 2 1 2 2 1 2 4 3 2 3 ... ## $ rBlst_1 : int 3 2 NA 6 2 3 3 3 3 5 ... ## $ Belonging : num 6.33 4.67 NA 3.33 4 5.33 5.67 7 6 3 ... ## $ ResponseBL: num 2.33 1.67 2 3.33 1.33 2.33 3.67 3 2.33 3.67 ... ## $ StigmaBL : num 3.33 4 3.5 2 1 1 4 3.67 1.67 3.33 ... ## $ ClimateBL : num 2.83 2.83 NA 2.67 1.17 1.67 3.83 3.33 2 3.5 ... The difference between int (integer) and num (numerical) is that integers are limited to whole numbers. In the functions used in this chapter, both are acceptable formats for the variables. # the script may look a little complicated; I could have simply written # describe(item_scores_df) #it would have given me descriptives for all the items in the df # because I only wanted a few variables, I provided them in a concatenated: list [c(&quot;iBIPOC_pr&quot;, &quot;cmBlack&quot;, &quot;Belonging&quot;, &quot;ClimateBL&quot;)] # I also added &quot;psych::&quot; in front of the command to make sure that R is using the describe function from the psych package # I popped the output into an object; objects are not required, but can be helpful to write as outfiles, to pipe elements of inline text, and to use with packages like apaTables # When we use an object, we need to write it below so the results will display descriptives &lt;- (psych::describe(item_scores_df[c(&quot;iBIPOC_pr&quot;, &quot;cmBlack&quot;, &quot;Belonging&quot;, &quot;ClimateBL&quot;)])) descriptives ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis ## iBIPOC_pr 1 36 0.44 0.40 0.33 0.42 0.49 0 1.00 1.00 0.37 -1.42 ## cmBlack 2 38 7.00 8.12 5.00 5.84 7.41 0 29.00 29.00 1.25 0.46 ## Belonging 3 37 4.20 1.49 4.00 4.23 1.48 1 7.00 6.00 -0.15 -0.91 ## ClimateBL 4 35 2.29 0.99 2.33 2.23 0.99 1 4.17 3.17 0.32 -1.07 ## se ## iBIPOC_pr 0.07 ## cmBlack 1.32 ## Belonging 0.24 ## ClimateBL 0.17 write.csv (descriptives, file=&quot;DataDx_descripts.csv&quot;) #this can be useful if you wish to manually format the data for an APA style table To understand whether our data are normally distributed, we can look at skew and kurtosis. The skew and kurtosis indices in the psych package are reported as z scores. Regarding skew, values &gt; 3.0 are generally considered severely skewed. Regarding kurtosis, severely kurtotic is argued anywhere &gt; 8 to 20 (Kline, 2016). At the time I am writing this chapter, our skew and kurtosis values fall below the thresholds that Kline identified as concerning. We can also apply the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality to each of our variables. When the \\(p\\) value is &lt; .05, the variables distribution is deviates from a normal distribution to a degree that is statistically significant. Below, the plotting of the histogram with a normal curve superimposed shows how the distribution approximates one that is normal. #The shapiro-test is in base R; it&#39;s specification is simple: shapiro.test(df$variable) #I added the object (and had to list it below) so I can use the inline text function SWt_i &lt;- shapiro.test(item_scores_df$iBIPOC_pr) SWt_cm &lt;- shapiro.test(item_scores_df$cmBlack) SWt_Bel &lt;-shapiro.test(item_scores_df$Belonging) SWt_Cl &lt;-shapiro.test(item_scores_df$ClimateBL) SWt_i ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: item_scores_df$iBIPOC_pr ## W = 0.82348, p-value = 4.939e-05 SWt_cm ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: item_scores_df$cmBlack ## W = 0.80586, p-value = 1.379e-05 SWt_Bel ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: item_scores_df$Belonging ## W = 0.97551, p-value = 0.5767 SWt_Cl ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: item_scores_df$ClimateBL ## W = 0.93431, p-value = 0.03763 CUMULATIVE CAPTURE FOR THE APA STYLE WRITE-UP: Regarding the distributional characteristics of the data, skew and kurtosis values of the variables fell below the values of 3 (skew) and 8 to 20 (kurtosis) that Kline suggests are concerning (2016). Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicate that our variables assessing the proportion of classmates who are Black (\\(W\\) = 0.806, \\(p\\) = 0.0000) and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff(\\(W\\) = 0.823, \\(p\\) = 0.0000) are statistically significantly different than a normal distribution. The scales assessing the respondents belonging (\\(W\\) = 0.976, \\(p\\) = 0.5767) and the respondents perception of campus climate for Black students (\\(W\\) = 0.934, \\(p\\) = 0.0376) did not differ differently from a normal distribution. Note. Owing to the open nature of the dataset, these values will change. While I have used inline text to update the values of the Shapiro Wilks and associated significance test, the text narration is not automatically updated and may be inconsistent with the results. What would we do in the case of a univariate outlier? I find Klines (2016) chapter on data preparation and management to be extremely useful. He provides ideas for more complex analysis of both univariate and multivariate normality and provides suggestions that range from recoding an extreme value to the next most extreme that is within three standard deviations of the mean to more complicated transformations. First, though we need to further examine the relationships between variables. We do that, next. 4.5.2 Pairs Panels As we work our way from univariate to multivariate inspection of our data, lets take a look at the bivariate relations. The pairs.panels() function from the psych package is useful for showing the relationship between variables (probably no more than 10) in a model. The lower half is a scatterplot between the two variables with a regression line (red) and mean (dot). The diagonal is a histogram of each variable. The upper half of is the correlation coefficient between the two variables. psych::pairs.panels(item_scores_df[c(&quot;iBIPOC_pr&quot;, &quot;cmBlack&quot;, &quot;Belonging&quot;, &quot;ClimateBL&quot;)], stars = TRUE, lm = TRUE) The histograms displayed in the diagonal graph for us what we learned from the Shapiro Wilks test of normality. We can clearly see the non-normal distribution in the iBIPOC_pr and cmBlack variables. 4.6 Evaluating Multivariate Normality Multivariate outliers have extreme scores on two or more variables, or a pattern of scores that is atypical. For example, a case may have scores between two and three standard deviations above the mean on all variables, even though no case would be extreme. A common method of multivariate outlier detection is the Mahalanobis distance (\\(D_{M}^{2}\\)). This indicates the distance in variance units between the profile of scores for that case and the vector of sample means, or centroid, correcting for intercorrelations. The outlier() function from the psych package tells us how far each datapoint is from the multivariate centroid of the data. That is, find the squared Mahalanobis distance for each data point and compare it to the expected values of \\(\\chi^2\\). The outlier() protocol also produces a Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot with the n most extreme data points labeled. The code below appends the Mahalanobis values to the dataframe. It is easy, then, to identify, sort, and examine the most extreme values (relative to the rest of the data in their case/row) to make decisions about their retention or adjustment. Numeric variables are required in the for the calculation of the Mahalanobis. item_scores_df$Mahal &lt;- psych::outlier(item_scores_df[c(&quot;iBIPOC_pr&quot;, &quot;cmBlack&quot;, &quot;Belonging&quot;, &quot;ClimateBL&quot;)]) Q-Q plots take your sample data, sort it in ascending order, and then plot them versus quantiles (the number varies; you can see it on the X axis) calculated from a theoretical distribution. The number of quantiles is selected to match the size of your sample data. While Normal Q-Q Plots are the ones most often used in practice due to so many statistical methods assuming normality, Q-Q Plots can actually be created for any distribution. To the degree that the plotted line stays on the straight line (representing the theoretical normal distribution), the data is multivariate normally distributed. It is possible, then to analyze the Mahalanobis distance values. psych::describe(item_scores_df$Mahal) ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis se ## X1 1 38 3.75 2.21 3.15 3.62 2.25 0.19 9.27 9.08 0.61 -0.4 0.36 Using this information we can determine cases that have a Mahalanobis distance values that exceeds three standard deviations around the median.

Specifically, we used the outlier() function in the psych package and included all continuous variables in the calculation. Our visual inspection of the Q-Q plot suggested that the plotted line strayed from the straight line as the quantiles increased. Additionally, we appended the Mahalanobis distance scores as a variable to the data. Analyzing this variable, we found that 0 exceed three standard deviations beyond the median. Thus, with no outliers, we assumed multivariate normality and proceeded with the data analysis AS DATA IS ADDED THIS NUMBER OF OUTLIERS COULD UPDATE FROM ZERO AND THIS TEXT COULD CHANGE. 4.7 A Few Words on Transformations To quote from Kline (2016), Before applying a normalizing transformation, you should think about the variables of interest and whether the expectation of normality is reasonable. (p. 77) At this point in history, the non-normal distribution of the proportions of classmates who are Black and instructional staff who are BIPOC are accurate representations in higher education. Kline (2016) has noted that transforming an inherently non-normal variable to force a normal distribution may fundamentally alter it such that the variable of interest is not actually studied. Klines chapter reviews some options for applying corrections to outliers. Additionally, the chapter describes a variety of normalizing transformations. On a personal note, while I will use stadardized scores (a linear transformation) if it improves interpretation and center variables around a meaningful intercept, I tend to resist the transformation of data without a really compelling reason. Why? Its complicated and can make interpretation difficult. 4.8 The APA Style Write-Up Since the focus of this chapter was on data diagnostics, the APA style writeup will focus on on this element of the Method section: 4.8.1 Data Diagnostics Data screening suggested that 52 individuals opened the survey link. Of those, 44 granted consent and proceeded to the survey items. A further inclusion criteria was that the course was taught in the U.S; 38 met this criteria. Available item analysis (AIA; (Parent, 2013)) is a strategy for managing missing data that uses available data for analysis and excludes cases with missing data points only for analyses in which the data points would be directly involved. Parent (2013) suggested that AIA is equivalent to more complex methods (e.g., multiple imputation) across a number of variations of sample size, magnitude of associations among items, and degree of missingness. Thus, we utilized Parents recommendations to guide our approach to managing missing data. Missing data analyses were conducted with tools in base R as well as the R packages, psych (v. 1.0.12) and mice (v. 3.13.0). Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from 0% to 36%. Across the dataset, 3.35% of cells had missing data and 84.21% of cases had nonmissing data. At this stage in the analysis, we allowed all cases with less than 90% missing to continue to the scoring stage. Guided by Parents (2013) AIA approach, scales with three items were scored if at least two items were non-missing; the scale with four items was scored if it at least three non-missing items; and the scale with six items was scored if it had at least five non-missing items. Across the 38 cases for which the scoring protocol was applied, missingness ranged from 0% to 33%. After eliminating cases with greater than 20% missing, the dataset analyzed included 35 cases. In this dataset we had 0.95% missing across the df; 94.29% of the rows had nonmissing data. Regarding the distributional characteristics of the data, skew and kurtosis values of the variables fell below the values of 3 (skew) and 8 to 20 (kurtosis) that Kline suggests are concerning (2016). Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicate that our variables assessing the proportion of classmates who are Black (\\(W\\) = 0.806, \\(p\\) = 0.0000) and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff(\\(W\\) = 0.823, \\(p\\) = 0.0000) are statistically significantly different than a normal distribution. The scales assessing the respondents belonging (\\(W\\) = 0.976, \\(p\\) = 0.5767) and the respondents perception of campus climate for Black students (\\(W\\) = 0.934, \\(p\\) = 0.0376) did not differ differently from a normal distribution. We evaluated multivariate normality with the Mahalanobis distance test. Specifically, we used the outlier() function in the psych package and included all continuous variables in the calculation. Our visual inspection of the Q-Q plot suggested that the plotted line strayed from the straight line as the quantiles increased. Additionally, we appended the Mahalanobis distance scores as a variable to the data. Analyzing this variable, we found that 0 exceed three standard deviations beyond the median. Thus, with no outliers, we assumed multivariate normality and proceeded with the data analysis AS DATA IS ADDED THIS NUMBER OF OUTLIERS COULD UPDATE FROM ZERO AND THIS TEXT COULD CHANGE. Given that our sample sizes were reasonable for the planned analyses and the degree of missingness was low, we used pairwise deletion in our multiple regression analysis. 4.9 A Quick Regression of our Research Vignette With some confidence that our scrubbed-and-scored variables are appropriate for analysis, let me conduct the super quick regression that is our research vignette.

Those multiple sets are considered together in analyses (such as regression) and interpretation is made on the pooled results. Much has been written about multiple imputation and, if used, should be done with many considerations. This chapter is intended as a brief introduction. In this chapter, I demonstrate the use of multiple imputation with the data from the Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise that has served as the research vignette for the first few chapters of this OER. 5.1 Navigating this Lesson There is about one hour of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be good to add another hour (to an hour-and-a-half). While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OERs introduction 5.1.1 Learning Objectives Learning objectives from this lecture include the following: Describe circumstances under which multiple imputation would be appropriate List and define the stages in multiple imputation. Apply multiple imputation to a dataset that has missingness Interpret results from a simple regression that uses multiple imputation Articulate how multiple imputation fits into the workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. Write up the results of an the process of imputation from raw data through analyzing a simple regression (or similar) analysis. 5.1.2 Planning for Practice The suggestions for practice are a continuation from the three prior chapters. If you have completed one or more of those assignments, you should have worked through the steps in preparing a data set and evaluating its appropriateness for the planned, statistical, analysis. This chapter takes a deviation from the AIA (Parent, 2013) approach that was the focus of the first few chapters in that we used multiple imputation as the approach for managing missingness. Options, of graded complexity, for practice include: Repeating the steps in the chapter with the most recent data from the Rate-A-Recent-Course survey; differences will be in the number of people who have completed the survey since the chapter was written. Use the dataset that is the source of the chapter, but score a different set of items that you choose. Begin with raw data to which you have access. 5.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s).

An image of a workflow for scrubbing and scoring data. In this lecture we are working on the right side of the flowchart in the multiple imputation (blue) section. Within it, there are two options, each with a slightly different set of options. imputing at the item level in this case, scales/subscales are scored after the item-level imputation imputating at the scale level in this case, scales/subscales are scored prior to the imputation; likely using some of the same criteria as identified in the scoring chapter (i.e., scoring if 75-80% of data are non-missing). Multiple imputation, then, is used to estimate the remaining, missing values. Whichever approach is used, the imputed variables (multiple sets) are used in a pooled analysis and results are interpreted from that analysis. 5.3 Research Vignette The research vignette comes from the survey titled, Rate-a-Recent-Course: A ReCentering Psych Stats Exercise and is explained in the scrubbing chapter. In the scoring chapter we prepared four variables for analysis. In the data diagnostics chapter we assessed the quality of the variables and conducted the multiple regression described below. Details for these are in our codebook. Lets quickly review the variables in our model: Perceived Campus Climate for Black Students includes 6 items, one of which was reverse scored. This scale was adapted from Szymanski et al.s (2020) Campus Climate for LGBTQ students. It has not been evaluated for use with other groups. The Szymanski et al. analysis suggested that it could be used as a total scale score, or divided into three items each that assess College response to LGBTQ students (items 6, 4, 1) LGBTQ stigma (items 3, 2, 5) Sense of Belonging includes 3 items. This is a subscale from Bollen and Hoyles (1990) Perceived Cohesion Scale. There are no items on this scale that require reversing. Percent of Black classmates is a single item that asked respondents to estimate the proportion of students in various racial categories Percent of BIPOC instructional staff, similarly, asked respondents to identify the racial category of each member of their instructional staff As we noted in the scrubbing chapter, our design has notable limitations. Briefly, (a) owing to the open source aspect of the data we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent; (b) the items that ask respondents to guess the identities of the instructional staff and to place them in broad categories, (c) we do not provide a write-in a response. We made these decisions after extensive conversation with stakeholders. The primary reason for these decisions was to prevent potential harm (a) to respondents who could be identified if/when the revealed private information in this open-source survey, and (b) trolls who would write inappropriate or harmful comments. As I think about how these variables go together (which is often where I start in planning a study), I suspect parallel mediation. That is the perception of campus climate for Black students would be predicted by the respondents sense of belonging, mediated in separate paths through the proportion of classmates who are Black and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff. I would like to assess the model by having the instructional staff variable to be the %Black instructional staff. At the time that this lecture is being prepared, there is not sufficient Black representation in the instructional staff to model this. An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data. As in the data diagnostic chapter, I will conclude this chapter by conducting a statistical analysis with the multiply imputed data. Because parallel mediation can be complicated (I teach it in a later chapter), I will demonstrate use of our prepared variables with a simple multiple regression. An image of the statistical model for which we are preparing data. 5.4 Multiple Imputation  a Super Brief Review Multiple imputation is complex. Numerous quantitative psychologists had critiqued it and provided numerous cautions and guidelines for its use (Enders, 2017, 2010; R. J. A. Little &amp; Rubin, 2002; T. D. Little et al., 2008). In brief, 5.4.1 Steps in Multiple Imputation Multiple imputation starts with a raw data file. Multiple imputation assumes that data are MAR (remember, MCAR is the more prestigious one). This means that researchers assume that missing values can be replaced by predictions derived from the observable portion of the dataset. Multiple datasets (often 5 to 20) are created where missing values are replaced via a randomized process (so the same missing value [item 4 for person A] will likely have different values for each dataset). The desired analysis is conducted simultaneously/separately for each of the imputed sets (so if you imputed 5 sets and wanted a linear regression, you get 5 linear regressions). A pooled analysis uses the point estimates and the standard errors to provide a single result that represents the analysis. In a web-hosted guide from the University of Virginia Library, Katitas (2019) provided a user-friendly review and example of using tools in R in a multiple imputation. Katitas figure is a useful conceptual tool in understanding how multiple imputation works. This figure is my recreation of Katitas original. An image adapted from the Katitas multiple imputation guide showing the four stages of multiple imputation. the dataframe with missing data is the single place we start we intervene with a package like mice() to impute multiple sets of data (filling in the missing variables with different values that are a product of their conditional distribution and an element of random); mids (multiply imputed dataset) is an object class where the completed datasets are stored. the with_mids command allows OLS regression to be run, as many times as we have imputed datasets (in this figure, 3X). It produces different regression coefficients for each datset the pool command pools together the multiple coefficients taking into consideration the value of the coefficients,the standard errors, and the variance of the missing value parameter across the samples. 5.4.2 Statistical Approaches to Multiple Imputation Joint multivariate normal distribution multiple imputation assumes that the observed data follow a multivariate normal distribution. The algorithm used draws from this assumed distribution. A drawback is that if the data do not follow a multivariate normal distribution, the imputed values are incorrect. Amelia and norm packages use this approach. Conditional multiple imputation is an iterative procedure, modeling the conditional distribution of a certain variable given the other variables. In this way the distribution is assumed for each variable, rather than or the entire dataset. mice uses this approach. mice: multivariate imputation by chained equations 5.5 Working the Problem Katitas (2019) claims that it is best to impute the data in its rawest form possible because any change would be taking it away from its original distribution. There are debates about how many variables to include in an imputation. Some authors would suggest that researchers include everything that was collected. Others (like me) will trim the dataset to include (a) the variables included in the model, plus (b) auxiliary variables (i.e., variables not in the model, but that are sufficiently non-missing and will provide additional information to the data). In our case we will want: Item for the variables represented in our model the item level responses to the scales/subscales respondents sense of belonging to campus (3 items) respondents rating of campus climate for Black students (6 items) proportion of BIPOC instructional staff proportion of classmates who are Black Auxiliary variables  lets choose four. One will be the format of the course. Three items will be from the course evaluation. format, whether the course was taught in-person, a blend, or virtual cEval_1, Course material was presented clearly cEval_13, Where applicable, issues were considered from multiple perspectives cEval_19, My understanding of the subject matter increased over the span of the course 5.5.1 Selecting and Formatting Variables There are some guidelines for selecting and formatting variables for imputation. Variables should be in their most natural state Redundant or too highly correlated variables should not be included If you reverse coded a variable (we havent yet), thats ok, but if you have already reverse-coded, then exclude the original variable Redundant variables (or multicollinear variables) may cause the multiple imputation process to cease Violation of this also provides clues for troubleshooting Exclude variables with more than 25% missing To make this as realistic as possible. Lets start with our very raw data. The Scrubbing chapter provides greater detail on importing data directly from Qualtrics. Therefore, I will repeat our protocol that imports the data and then scrubs it for our purposes. As described in the prior chapter, I named variables in Qualtrics to facilitate a more intuitive use in R. library(qualtRics) QTRX_df2 &lt;- qualtRics::fetch_survey(surveyID = &quot;SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU&quot;,useLocalTime = TRUE, verbose = FALSE, label=FALSE, convert=FALSE, force_request = TRUE, import_id = FALSE) Next, I apply inclusion/exclusion criteria. As described in the Scrubbing chapter this includes: excluding all previews including only those who consented including only those whose rated course was offered by a U.S. institution library(tidyverse) QTRX_df2 &lt;- filter (QTRX_df2, DistributionChannel != &quot;preview&quot;) QTRX_df2 &lt;-filter (QTRX_df2, Consent == 1) QTRX_df2 &lt;-filter (QTRX_df2, USinst == 0) Preparing the data also meant renaming some variables that started with numbers (a hassle in R). I also renamed variables on the Campus Climate scale so that we know to which subscale they belong. library(tidyverse) #renaming variables that started with numbers QTRX_df2 &lt;- rename(QTRX_df2, iRace1 = &#39;1_iRace&#39;, iRace2 = &#39;2_iRace&#39;, iRace3 = &#39;3_iRace&#39;, iRace4 = &#39;4_iRace&#39;, iRace5 = &#39;5_iRace&#39;, iRace6 = &#39;6_iRace&#39;, iRace7 = &#39;7_iRace&#39;, iRace8 = &#39;8_iRace&#39;, iRace9 = &#39;9_iRace&#39;, iRace10 = &#39;10_iRace&#39;) #renaming variables from the identification of classmates QTRX_df2 &lt;- rename(QTRX_df2, cmBiMulti = Race_10, cmBlack = Race_1, cmNBPoC = Race_7, cmWhite = Race_8, cmUnsure = Race_2) The Qualtrics download does not include an ID number. Because new variables are always appended to the end of the df, we also include code to make this the first column. QTRX_df2 &lt;- QTRX_df2 %&gt;% mutate(ID = row_number()) #moving the ID number to the first column; requires QTRX_df2 &lt;- QTRX_df2%&gt;%select(ID, everything()) Because this huge df is cumbersome to work with, lets downsize it to be closer to the size we will work with in the imputation mimp_df &lt;- select (QTRX_df2, ID, iRace1, iRace2, iRace3, iRace4, iRace5, iRace6, iRace7, iRace8, iRace9, iRace10, cmBiMulti, cmBlack, cmNBPoC, cmWhite, cmUnsure, Belong_1:Belong_3, Blst_1:Blst_6, cEval_1, cEval_13, cEval_19, format) #glimpse(mimp_df) head(mimp_df) ## # A tibble: 6 x 29 ## ID iRace1 iRace2 iRace3 iRace4 iRace5 iRace6 iRace7 iRace8 iRace9 iRace10 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 1 3 1 3 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 2 2 3 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 3 3 3 1 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 4 4 3 1 3 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 5 5 1 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 6 6 3 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## # ... with 18 more variables: cmBiMulti &lt;dbl&gt;, cmBlack &lt;dbl&gt;, cmNBPoC &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # cmWhite &lt;dbl&gt;, cmUnsure &lt;dbl&gt;, Belong_1 &lt;dbl&gt;, Belong_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Belong_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, Blst_1 &lt;dbl&gt;, Blst_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, Blst_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, Blst_4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Blst_5 &lt;dbl&gt;, Blst_6 &lt;dbl&gt;, cEval_1 &lt;dbl&gt;, cEval_13 &lt;dbl&gt;, cEval_19 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # format &lt;dbl&gt; 5.5.2 Creating Composite Variables Qualtrics imports many of the categorical variables as numbers. R often reads them numerically (integers or numbers). If they are directly converted to factors, R will sometimes collapse. In this example, if there is a race that is not represented (e.g., 2 for BiMulti), when the numbers are changed to factors, R will assume its ordered and will change up the numbers. Therefore, it is ESSENTIAL to check (again and again ad nauseum) to ensure that your variables are recoding in a manner you understand. mimp_df$iRace1 = factor(mimp_df$iRace1, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) mimp_df$iRace2 = factor(mimp_df$iRace2, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) mimp_df$iRace3 = factor(mimp_df$iRace3, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) mimp_df$iRace4 = factor(mimp_df$iRace4, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) mimp_df$iRace5 = factor(mimp_df$iRace5, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) mimp_df$iRace6 = factor(mimp_df$iRace6, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) mimp_df$iRace7 = factor(mimp_df$iRace7, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) mimp_df$iRace8 = factor(mimp_df$iRace8, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) mimp_df$iRace9 = factor(mimp_df$iRace9, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) mimp_df$iRace10 = factor(mimp_df$iRace10, levels = c(0,1,2,3,4), labels = c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;NotNotice&quot;)) head(mimp_df) This is a quick recap of how we calculated the proportion of instructional staff who are BIPOC. #creating a count of BIPOC faculty identified by each respondent mimp_df$count.BIPOC &lt;- apply(mimp_df[c(&quot;iRace1&quot;, &quot;iRace2&quot;, &quot;iRace3&quot;, &quot;iRace4&quot;, &quot;iRace5&quot;, &quot;iRace6&quot;, &quot;iRace7&quot;, &quot;iRace8&quot;, &quot;iRace9&quot;, &quot;iRace10&quot;)], 1, function(x) sum(x %in% c(&quot;Black&quot;, &quot;nBpoc&quot;, &quot;BiMulti&quot;))) #creating a count of all instructional faculty identified by each respondent mimp_df$count.nMiss &lt;- apply(mimp_df[c(&quot;iRace1&quot;, &quot;iRace2&quot;, &quot;iRace3&quot;, &quot;iRace4&quot;, &quot;iRace5&quot;, &quot;iRace6&quot;, &quot;iRace7&quot;, &quot;iRace8&quot;, &quot;iRace9&quot;, &quot;iRace10&quot;)], 1, function(x) sum(!is.na(x))) #calculating the proportion of BIPOC faculty with the counts above mimp_df$iBIPOC_pr = mimp_df$count.BIPOC/mimp_df$count.nMiss I have included another variable, format that we will use as auxiliary variable. As written, these are the following meanings: In-person (all persons are attending in person) In person (some students are attending remotely) Blended: some sessions in person and some sessions online/virtual Online or virtual Other Lets recoded it to have three categories: 100% in-person (1) Some sort of blend/mix (2, 3) 100% online/virtual (4) NA. Other (5) #we can assign more than one value to the same factor by repeating the label mimp_df$format = factor(mimp_df$format, levels = c(1,2,3,4,5), labels = c(&quot;InPerson&quot;, &quot;Blend&quot;, &quot;Blend&quot;, &quot;Online&quot;, is.na(5))) Lets trim the df again to just include the variables we need in the imputation. mimp_df &lt;- select (mimp_df, ID, iBIPOC_pr, cmBlack, Belong_1:Belong_3, Blst_1:Blst_6, cEval_1, cEval_13, cEval_19, format) Recall one of the guidelines was to remove variables with more than 25% missing. This code calculates the proportion missing from our variables and places them in rank order. p_missing &lt;- unlist(lapply(mimp_df, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))/nrow(mimp_df) sort(p_missing[p_missing &gt; 0], decreasing = TRUE) ## Blst_1 iBIPOC_pr Blst_4 Belong_1 Belong_3 Blst_2 Blst_3 ## 0.10526316 0.05263158 0.05263158 0.02631579 0.02631579 0.02631579 0.02631579 ## Blst_5 Blst_6 cEval_1 cEval_19 ## 0.02631579 0.02631579 0.02631579 0.02631579 Luckily, none of our variables have more than 25% missing (or at least they didnt when I wrote this; the open nature of the survey and how it sources this chapter could change this). If we did have a variable with more than 25% missing, we would have to consider what to do about it. Later we learn that we should eliminate case with greater than 50% missingness. Lets write code for that, now. #Calculating number and proportion of item-level missingness mimp_df$nmiss &lt;- mimp_df%&gt;% select(iBIPOC_pr:format) %&gt;% #the colon allows us to include all variables between the two listed (the variables need to be in order) is.na %&gt;% rowSums mimp_df&lt;- mimp_df%&gt;% mutate(prop_miss = (nmiss/15)*100) #11 is the number of variables included in calculating the proportion mimp_df &lt;- filter(mimp_df, prop_miss &lt;= 50) #update df to have only those with at least 50% of complete data Once again, trim the df to include only the data to be included in the imputation mimp_df &lt;- select (mimp_df, ID, iBIPOC_pr, cmBlack, Belong_1:Belong_3, Blst_1:Blst_6, cEval_1, cEval_13, cEval_19, format) 5.5.3 The Multiple Imputation Because multiple imputation is a random process, if we all want the same answers we need to set a random seed. set.seed(210404) #you can pick any number you want, today I&#39;m using today&#39;s datestamp The program we will use is mice. mice assumes that each variable has a distribution and it imputes missing variables according to that distribution. This means we need to correctly specify each variables format/role. mice will automatically choose a distribution (think format) for each variable; we can override this by changing the methods characteristics. The following code sets up the structure for the imputation. Im not an expert at this  just following the Katitas example. library(mice) # runs the mice code with 0 iterations imp &lt;- mice(mimp_df, maxit = 0) # Extract predictor Matrix and methods of imputation predM = imp$predictorMatrix meth = imp$method Here we code what format/role each variable should be. #These variables are left in the dataset, but setting them = 0 means they are not used as predictors. #We want our ID to be retained in the df. There&#39;s nothing missing from it, and we don&#39;t want it used as a predictor, so it will just hang out. predM[, c(&quot;ID&quot;)]=0 #If you like, view the first few rows of the predictor matrix #head(predM) #We don&#39;t have any ordered categorical variables, but if we did we would follow this format #poly &lt;- c(&quot;Var1&quot;, &quot;Var2&quot;) #We don&#39;t have any dichotomous variables, but if we did we would follow this format #log &lt;- c(&quot;Var3&quot;, &quot;Var4&quot;) #Unordered categorical variables (nominal variables), but if we did we would follow this format poly2 &lt;- c(&quot;format&quot;) #Turn their methods matrix into the specified imputation models #Remove the hashtag if you have any of these variables #meth[poly] = &quot;polr&quot; #meth[log] = &quot;logreg&quot; meth[poly2] = &quot;polyreg&quot; meth ## ID iBIPOC_pr cmBlack Belong_1 Belong_2 Belong_3 Blst_1 Blst_2 ## &quot;&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; ## Blst_3 Blst_4 Blst_5 Blst_6 cEval_1 cEval_13 cEval_19 format ## &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;polyreg&quot; This list (meth) contains all our variables; pmm is the default and is the predictive mean matching process used. We see that format (an unordered categorical variable) is noted as polyreg. If we had used other categorical variables (ordered/poly, dichotomous/log), we would have seen those designations, instead. If there is \"\" underneath it means the data is complete. Our variables of interest are now configured to be imputed with the imputation method we specified. Empty cells in the method matrix mean that those variables arent going to be imputed. If a variable has no missing values, it is automatically set to be empty. We can also manually set variables to not be imputed with the meth[variable]=\"\" command. The code below begins the imputation process. We are asking for 5 datasets. If you have many cases and many variables, this can take awhile. How many imputations? Recommendations have ranged as low as five to several hundred. # With this command, we tell mice to impute the anesimpor2 data, create 5vvdatasets, use predM as the predictor matrix and don&#39;t print the imputation process. #If you would like to see the process (or if the process is failing to execute) set print as TRUE; seeing where the execution halts can point to problematic variables (more notes at end of lecture) imp2 &lt;- mice(mimp_df, maxit = 5, predictorMatrix = predM, method = meth, print = FALSE) ## Warning: Number of logged events: 275 We need to create a long file that stacks all the imputed data. Looking at the df in R Studio shows us that when imp = 0 (the pe-imputed data), there is still missingness. As we scroll through the remaining imputations, there are no NA cells. # First, turn the datasets into long format # This procedure is, best I can tell, unique to mice and wouldn&#39;t work for repeated measures designs mimp_long &lt;- mice::complete(imp2, action=&quot;long&quot;, include = TRUE) If we look at it, we can see 6 sets of data. Playing with it .imp = 0 is the unimputed set; there are still missing values .imp = 1, 2, 3, or 5 has no missing values for the variables we included in the imputation Sort on the ID number to see how this works6 sets of data. With this fully imputed file, lets recode the data as we had done for the OLS regression with the raw, unimputed, data. p_missing_mimp_long &lt;- unlist(lapply(mimp_long, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))/nrow(mimp_long) sort(p_missing_mimp_long[p_missing_mimp_long &gt; 0], decreasing = TRUE)#check to see if this works 5.5.4 Creating Scale Scores Because our imputation was item-level, we need to score the variables with scales/subscales. As demonstrated more completely in the Scoring chapter, this required reversing one item in the campus climate scale: mimp_long&lt;- mimp_long %&gt;% mutate(rBlst_1 = 8 - Blst_1) #if you had multiple items, you could add a pipe (%&gt;%) at the end of the line and add more until the last one Below is the scoring protocol we used in the AIA protocol for scoring. Although the protocol below functionally says, \"Create a mean score if (65-80)% is non-missing, for the imputed version, it doesnt harm anything to leave this because there is no missing data. library(sjstats) #Making the list of variables Belonging_vars &lt;- c(&#39;Belong_1&#39;,&#39;Belong_2&#39;,&#39;Belong_3&#39;) ResponseBL_vars &lt;- c(&#39;rBlst_1&#39;, &#39;Blst_4&#39;,&#39;Blst_6&#39;) StigmaBL_vars &lt;- c(&#39;Blst_2&#39;, &#39;Blst_3&#39;,&#39;Blst_5&#39;) ClimateBL_vars &lt;- c(&#39;rBlst_1&#39;, &#39;Blst_4&#39;,&#39;Blst_6&#39;,&#39;Blst_2&#39;, &#39;Blst_3&#39;,&#39;Blst_5&#39; ) #Creating the new variables mimp_long$Belonging &lt;- mean_n(mimp_long[,Belonging_vars], .65) mimp_long$ResponseBL &lt;- mean_n(mimp_long[,ResponseBL_vars], .80) mimp_long$StigmaBL &lt;- mean_n(mimp_long[,StigmaBL_vars], .80) mimp_long$ClimateBL &lt;- mean_n(mimp_long[,ClimateBL_vars], .80) 5.6 Multiple Regression with Multiply Imputed Data For a refresher, here was the script when we used the AIA approach for managing missingness: Climate_fit &lt;- lm(ClimateBL ~ Belonging + cmBlack + iBIPOC_pr, data = item_scores_df) summary(Climate_fit) In order for the regression to use multiply imputed data, it must be a mids (multiply imputed data sets) type # Convert to mids type - mice can work with this type mimp_mids&lt;-as.mids(mimp_long) Heres what we do with imputed data: fitimp &lt;- with(mimp_mids, lm(ClimateBL ~ Belonging + cmBlack + iBIPOC_pr)) In this process, 5 individual, OLS, regressions are being conducted and the results being pooled into this single set. # to get the 5, individual imputations summary(fitimp) ## # A tibble: 20 x 6 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value nobs ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 2.58 0.577 4.48 0.0000805 38 ## 2 Belonging -0.000893 0.118 -0.00757 0.994 38 ## 3 cmBlack -0.0172 0.0212 -0.808 0.425 38 ## 4 iBIPOC_pr -0.240 0.435 -0.553 0.584 38 ## 5 (Intercept) 2.60 0.572 4.54 0.0000669 38 ## 6 Belonging -0.00414 0.118 -0.0349 0.972 38 ## 7 cmBlack -0.0172 0.0213 -0.808 0.425 38 ## 8 iBIPOC_pr -0.254 0.431 -0.590 0.559 38 ## 9 (Intercept) 2.60 0.543 4.78 0.0000330 38 ## 10 Belonging 0.0202 0.116 0.175 0.862 38 ## 11 cmBlack -0.0189 0.0204 -0.926 0.361 38 ## 12 iBIPOC_pr -0.505 0.436 -1.16 0.256 38 ## 13 (Intercept) 2.60 0.544 4.77 0.0000338 38 ## 14 Belonging -0.0103 0.112 -0.0922 0.927 38 ## 15 cmBlack -0.0180 0.0207 -0.867 0.392 38 ## 16 iBIPOC_pr -0.233 0.418 -0.556 0.582 38 ## 17 (Intercept) 2.52 0.578 4.36 0.000113 38 ## 18 Belonging 0.0163 0.120 0.136 0.893 38 ## 19 cmBlack -0.0190 0.0214 -0.884 0.383 38 ## 20 iBIPOC_pr -0.201 0.434 -0.463 0.646 38 # the pooled result pooledests &lt;- pool(fitimp) pooledests ## Class: mipo m = 5 ## term m estimate ubar b t dfcom ## 1 (Intercept) 5 2.578918801 0.3168579493 1.069500e-03 0.3181413496 34 ## 2 Belonging 5 0.004230366 0.0136383176 1.774196e-04 0.0138512211 34 ## 3 cmBlack 5 -0.018047803 0.0004426305 7.621488e-07 0.0004435451 34 ## 4 iBIPOC_pr 5 -0.286610867 0.1857887593 1.524495e-02 0.2040827000 34 ## df riv lambda fmi ## 1 32.02824 0.004050396 0.004034057 0.06090051 ## 2 31.60868 0.015610688 0.015370740 0.07227145 ## 3 32.09475 0.002066235 0.002061974 0.05893305 ## 4 27.65271 0.098466348 0.089639841 0.14903819 #str(pooledests) sumpooled &lt;- summary(pool(fitimp)) sumpooled ## term estimate std.error statistic df p.value ## 1 (Intercept) 2.578918801 0.56404020 4.57222516 32.02824 6.846407e-05 ## 2 Belonging 0.004230366 0.11769121 0.03594462 31.60868 9.715526e-01 ## 3 cmBlack -0.018047803 0.02106051 -0.85694994 32.09475 3.978263e-01 ## 4 iBIPOC_pr -0.286610867 0.45175513 -0.63443854 27.65271 5.310089e-01 #str(sumpooled) Results of a multiple regression predicting the respondents perceptions of campus climate for Black students indicated that neither contributions of the respondents personal belonging (\\(B\\) = 0.004, \\(p\\) = 0.972) nor the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff (\\(B\\) = -0.287, \\(p\\) = 0.531) led to statistically significant changes in perceptions of campus climate for Black students. Results did suggest a statistically significant negative effect of the proportion of Black classmates on the campus climate for Black students. Specifically, as the proportion of Black students increases, there is less stigmatization and hostility on the campus (\\(B\\) = -0.018, \\(p\\) = 0.398). Results are presented in Table X. 5.7 Toward the APA Style Write-up 5.7.1 Method/Data Diagnostics Data screening suggested that 52 individuals opened the survey link. Of those, 44 granted consent and proceeded to the survey items. A further inclusion criteria was that the course was taught in the U.S; 38 met this criteria. Across cases that were deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, missingness ranged from 0% to 36%. Across the dataset, 3.35% of cells had missing data and 84.21% of cases had nonmissing data. At this stage in the analysis, we allowed all cases with fewer than 50% missing to be included the multiple imputation (Katitas, 2019). Regarding the distributional characteristics of the data, skew and kurtosis values of the variables fell below the values of 3 (skew) and 8 to 20 (kurtosis) that Kline suggests are concerning (2016). Results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality indicate that our variables assessing the proportion of classmates who are Black (\\(W\\) = 0.806, \\(p\\) = 0.0000) and the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff(\\(W\\) = 0.823, \\(p\\) = 0.0000) are statistically significantly different than a normal distribution. The scales assessing the respondents belonging (\\(W\\) = 0.976, \\(p\\) = 0.5767) and the respondents perception of campus climate for Black students (\\(W\\) = 0.934, \\(p\\) = 0.0376) did not differ differently from a normal distribution. We evaluated multivariate normality with the Mahalanobis distance test. Specifically, we used the outlier() function in the psych package and included all continuous variables in the calculation. Our visual inspection of the Q-Q plot suggested that the plotted line strayed from the straight line as the quantiles increased. Additionally, we appended the Mahalanobis distance scores as a variable to the data. Analyzing this variable, we found that 0 exceed three standard deviations beyond the median. Thus, with no outliers, we assumed multivariate normality and proceeded with the data analysis AS DATA IS ADDED THIS NUMBER OF OUTLIERS COULD UPDATE FROM ZERO AND THIS TEXT COULD CHANGE.* We managed missing data with multiple imputation (Enders, 2017; Katitas, 2019). We imputed five sets of data with the R package, mice (v. 3.13)  a program that utilizes conditional multiple imputation. The imputation included the item-level variables that comprised our scales, the variables that represented proportion of BIPOC instructional staff and proportion of Black classmates, as well as four auxiliary variables (three variables from the course evaluation and the format [in-person/blended/virtual] of the class). 5.7.2 Results Results of a multiple regression predicting the respondents perceptions of campus climate for Black students indicated that neither contributions of the respondents personal belonging (\\(B\\) = 0.050, \\(p\\) = 0.684) nor the proportion of BIPOC instructional staff (\\(B\\) = -0.456, \\(p\\) = 0.312) led to statistically significant changes in perceptions of campus climate for Black students. Results did suggest a statistically significant negative effect of the proportion of Black classmates on the campus climate for Black students. Specifically, as the proportion of Black students increases, there is less stigmatization and hostility on the campus (\\(B\\) = -0.015, \\(p\\) = 0.457). Although it accounted for 5.28% of the variance, the overall model was not statistically significant. Results are presented in Table 2. Some notes about this write-up I went ahead and used the data diagnostics that we did in the AIA method. It feels to me like these should be calculated with the multiply imputed data (i.e., 5 sets, with pooled estimates and standard errors), but I do not see that modeled  anywhere in R. Note the similarities with the AIA write-up. 5.8 Multiple imputation considerations Character vectors (i.e., values that are represented with words) can be problematic. If they are causing trouble, consider recode into factors, keep it in the df, but exclude it from the imputation protocol, our format variable was an ordered factor (i.e., each term was associated with a value), so I think that helped us avoid problems Variables with really high (like 50% or more) proportions of missingness should be excluded. Variables that are highly correlated or redundant (even if inverse) will halt the execution. If you set print=TRUE you will see where the algorithm is having difficulty because it will halt at that variable. Variables with non-missing values can be problematic. If they are problematic, just exclude them from the process. *Width (columns/variables) versus length (rows/cases). You must have more rows/cases than columns/variables. It is difficult to say how many. If this is a problem: Consider scoring scales first with AIA, then impute with whole scales. Divide the df in halves or thirds, impute separately, then join with the ID numbers. There should be auxiliary variables in each. *Item-level imputation is its whole big thing with multiple, complex considerations. There are tremendous resources Enders BLIMP app is free and works with R Littles (2002) article How many imputations? Controversial and has changed over the years. Practical concern: the more you request, the longer it will take in R, this demo was 5 For a number of years there was a push for 20, but Ive also seen recommendations for 100s. Check examples of imputed studies in your disciplinary specialty/journals. There are lots of discussions and debates about allowing for fractional/decimal responses (a 3.5 on 1 to 4 scaling; or a 0.75 on a dichotomous variable such as male/female) out-of-bounds estimates (what if you get a 7 on 1 to 4 scaling?) 5.9 Practice Problems The three problems described below are designed to be continuations from the previous chapters.

We examine the logic/design required to support the argument that mediation is the mechanism that explains the X &gt; Y relationship. We also work three examples (one with covariates). At the outset, please note that although I rely heavily on Hayes (2018) text and materials, I am using the R package lavaan in these chapters. Very recently, Hayes has introduced a PROCESS macro for R. Because I am not yet up-to-speed on using this macro (it is not a typical R package) and because we will use lavaan for confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, I have chosen to utilize the lavaan package. A substantial difference is that the PROCESS macros use ordinary least squares and lavaan uses maximum likelihood estimators. 6.1 Navigating this Lesson There is about 1 hour and 10 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional 1.5 hours. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, ocasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OERs introduction 6.1.1 Learning Objectives Learning objectives from this lecture include the following: Define mediation and indirect effect. Distinguish the role of a mediating variable from independent variables, covariates, and moderators. Identify the conditions upon which there can be justification to support the presence of a mediated effect. Articulate the arguments for and against using the term, mediation. Using the R package lavaan, specify a model with indirect effects, identify and interpret B weights, p values, and CIs for total, direct, and indirect effects, calculate the total effects of X and M on Y, identify the proportion of variance accounted for in predicting M and Y. Hand calculate the values of an indirect, direct, and total effects from statistical output or a figure (just the \\(B\\) or \\(\\beta\\), not the significance level) 6.1.2 Planning for Practice The following suggestions for practice will involve specifying, testing, and interpreting a model with a single indirect effect (mediator). Rework the problem in the chapter by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data. This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar. There are a number of variables in the dataset and there were a handful of simple mediations conducted in the journal article that sources the research vignette. Swap out one or more variables in the model of simple mediation and compare your solution to the one in the chapter and/or the research article. Conduct a simple mediation with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article. 6.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s). Other resources are cited (when possible, linked) in the text with complete citations in the reference list. Hayes, A. F. (2018). Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process anlaysis: A regression-based approach. New York, NY: Guilford Press. Available as an ebook from the SPU library: https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.ezproxy.spu.edu/lib/spu/detail.action?docID=5109647 Chapter 3, Simple mediation: Hayes text is another great example of a teaching tool that is accessible at both procedural and conceptual levels. I especially appreciate his attention to the controversies (even those directed toward his work). We deviate from his text in that we are not using the PROCESS macroand Ill address those concerns in the lecture. Chapter 4, Causality and confounds: A great chapter that addresses What happened to Baron &amp; Kenny; partial v complete mediation; and conditions required for claims of causality. Procedurally, our focus in this chapter is on the role of covariates. Appendix A: Using Process: An essential tool for PROCESS users because, even when we are in the R environment, this is the idea book. That is, the place where all the path models are presented in figures. Kim, P. Y., Kendall, D. L., &amp; Cheon, H.-S. (2017).

Conditional process analysis involves both! With each of these, we are seeking to understand the mechanism at work that leads to the relationship (be it correlational, predictive, or causal) Even though this process has sometimes been termed causal modeling, Hayes argues that his statistical approach is not claiming to determine cause; that is really left to the argument of the research design. Moderation (a review): Answers questions of when or for whom and is often the source of the answer, it depends. Think of our interaction effects in ANOVA and regression The effect of X on some variable Y is moderated by W if its size, sign, or strength depends on, or can be predicted, by W. Then we can say, W is a moderator of Xs effect on Y or W and X interact in their influence on Y. The image below illustrates moderation with conceptual and statistical diagrams. Note that three predictors (IV, DV, their interaction) point to the DV. Image of Hayesstyle conceptual and statistical diagrams of a simple moderation The classic plot of moderation results is often the best way to detect that an interaction was included in the analysis and helps understand the conditional (e.g., for whom, under what conditions) nature of the analysis. Image of classic interaction graph that illustrates a moderated effect. The IV is on the X axis, DV on the Y axis, and two intersecting lines represent the differential/moderated effect of the IV on the DV by the moderator Mediation: Answers questions of how (I also think through and via to describe the proposed mediating mechanism) Paths in a mediation model are direct (X does not pass through M on its way to Y) and indirect (X passes through M on its way to Y). Once we get into the statistics, we will also be focused on total effects. Hayes thinks in terms of antecedent and consequent variables. In a 3-variable, simple mediation, X and M are the antecedent variables; X and M are the consequent variables. There is substantial debate and controversy about whether we can say the effect of X on Y is mediated through M or whether we should say, There is a statistically significant indirect effect of X on Y thru M. Hayes comes down on the use mediation language side of the debate. In sum, a simple mediation model is any causal system in which at least one causal antecedent X variable is proposed as influencing an outcome Y through a single intervening variable, M. In such a model there are two pathways by which X can influence Y. The figure below doubles as both the conceptual and statistical diagram of evaluating a simple mediation  a simple indirect effect. Image of Hayesstyle conceptual diagram of a simple moderation Conditional process analysis: Used when the research goal is to understand the boundary conditions of the mechanism(s) by which a variable transmits its effect on another. Typically, simultaneously, assesses the influence of mediating (indirect effects) and moderating (interactional effects) in a model-building fashion. In a conditional process model, the moderator(s) may be hypothesized to influence one or more of the paths. We will work toward building a conditional process model, a moderated mediation, over the next several chapters. Image of conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a path; the path between the IV and mediator 6.3 Workflow for Simple Mediation The workflow for a simple mediation is straightforward, however the figure below (i.e., the very traditional figure used to represent mediation) is very helpful in understanding the logic beneath mediation as the explanatory mechanism. Image of conditional process analysis model where the mediator is hypothesized to change the a path; the path between the IV and mediator The top figure represents the bivariate relationship between the independent and dependent variable. The result of a simple linear regression (one predictor) represent the total effect of the IV on the DV. We can calculate this by simply regressing the DV onto the IV. The resulting \\(B\\) weight is known as the c path. A bivariate correlation coefficient results in the same value  only it is standardized (so would be the same as the \\(\\beta\\) weight). The lower figure represents that the relationship between the IV and DV is mediated by a third variable. We assign three labels to the paths: a, between the IV and mediator; b, between the mediator and DV; and c (c prime) between the IV and DV. Statistically speaking, a mediated relationship is supported when the value of c is statistically significantly lower than c. If this occurs, then we can say that the mediator is sharing some of the variance in the prediction of the DV. You might already be imagining potential challenges to this model. For example, which variable should be the IV and which one should be the mediator? Can we switch them? You can  and you will likely have very similar (if not identical) results. Good research design is what provides support for suggesting that mediation is the proper, casual, mechanism regarding the relationship between the IV and DV. An excellent review of the challenges of establishing a robust mediation model is provided by Kline (2015), where he suggests the following as the minimally required elements of a mediation design: the IV is an experimental variable with random assignment to conditions; the mediator is an individual difference variable that is not manipulated and is measured at a later time;and the DV is measured at a third occasion These criteria are in addition to the rather standard criteria for establishing causality (see Stone-Romero &amp; Rosopa, 2010 for a review): temporal precedence, statistical covariation, and ruling out plausible rival hypotheses. Some journals take this very seriously. In fact FAQs in the Journal of Vocational Behavior make it clear that they will very rarely publish a mediation manuscript unless it has a minimum of three waves. Working through a mediation will help operationalize these concepts. 6.4 Simple Mediation in lavaan: A focus on the mechanics The lavaan tutorial (Rosseel, 2020) provides a helpful model of how writing code to estimate an indirect effect. Using the lavaan tutorial as our guide, lets start with just a set of fake data with variable names that represent X (predictor, IV, antecedent), M (mediator, atencedent, consequent), and Y (outcome, DV, consequent). 6.4.1 Simulate Fake Data The code below is asking to create a dataset with a sample size of 100. The dataset has 3 variables, conveniently named X (predictor, antecedent, IV), M (mediator), and Y (outome, consequent, DV). The R code asks for random selection of numbers with a normal distribution. You can see that the M variable will be related to the X variable by + .5; and the Y variable will be related to the M variable by + .7. This rather ensures a statistically significant indirect effect. set.seed(210410) X &lt;- rnorm(100) M &lt;- 0.5*X + rnorm(100) Y &lt;- 0.7*M + rnorm(100) Data &lt;- data.frame(X = X, Y = Y, M = M) 6.4.2 Specify Mediation Model The package we are using is lavaan. Hayes model is path analysis, which can be a form of structural equation modeling. As a quick reminder, in SPSS, PROCESS is limited to ordinary least squares regression. We will use maximum likliehood estimators for the Hayes/PROCESS examples, but lavaan can take us further than PROCESS because We can (and, in later chapters, will) do latent variable modeling. We can have more specificity and flexibility than the prescribed PROCESS models allow. I say this with all due respect to Hayes  there is also a good deal of flexibility to be able to add multiple mediators and covariates within most of the Hayes prescribed models. Hayes text is still a great place to start because the conceptual and procedural information is clear and transferable to the R environment. library(lavaan) ## This is lavaan 0.6-7 ## lavaan is BETA software! Please report any bugs. ## ## Attaching package: &#39;lavaan&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:psych&#39;: ## ## cor2cov Our atheoretical dataset makes it easy to identify which variable belongs in each role (X,Y,M). When specifying the paths in lavaan, heres what to keep in mind: Name your model/object (below is X, &lt;- means is defined by) The model exists between 2 single quotation marks (the odd looking  and  at the beginning and end). The # of regression equations you need depends on the # of variables that have arrows pointing to them. In a simple mediation, there are 3 variables with 2 variables having arrows pointing to them  need 2 regression equations: one for the Mediator one for the DV (Y) Operator for a regression analysis is the (tilde, ~) DV goes on left In first equation we regress both the X and M onto Y In second equation we regress M onto X The asterisk (*) is a handy tool to label variables (dont confuse it as defining an interaction); this labeling as a, b, and c_p (in traditional mediation, the total effect is labeled with a and the direct effect is c[c prime], but the script wont allow and extra single quotation mark, hence c_p) is super helpful in interpreting the ouput The indirect effect is created by multiplying the a and b paths. The := sign is used when creating a new variable that is a function of variables in the model, but not in the dataset (i.e., the a and b path). After specifying the model, we create an object that holds our results from the SEM. To obtain all the results from our of indirect effects, we also need to print a summary of the fit statistics, standardized estimates, r-squared, and confidence intervals. Other authors will write the model code more sensibly, predicting the mediator first, and then the Y variable. However, I found that by doing it this way, the semPlot produces a more sensible figure. Also, because we set a random seed, you should get the same results, but if it differs a little, dont panic.

The second set (in the really nice dataframe) includes bootstrapped, bias-corrected confidence intervals. Bias-corrected confidence interals have the advantage of being more powerful and bias-free. Note, though, that when the CI crosses 0, the effect is NS. So lets look at this step-by-step. Overall, our model accounted for 40.96% of the variance in the IV and 32.97% of the variance in the mediator. a path = 0.693, \\(p\\) = 0.000 b path = 0.764, \\(p\\) = 0.000 the indirect effect is a product of the a and b paths (0.693 * 0.764 = 0.529); while we dont hand calculate its significance, we see that it is \\(p\\) = 0.000 the direct effect (c, c prime, or c_p) is the isolated effect of X on Y when including M. We hope this value is LOWER than the total effect because this means that including M shared some of the variance in predicting Y: c = -0.209, \\(p\\) = 0.062, and it is no longer signifcant. we also see the total effect; this value is identical to the value of simply predicting Y on X (with no M it the model) the value of a(b) + c_p: 0.693(0.764) + -0.209 = 0.321 (\\(p\\) = 0.010) Heres a demonstration that the total effect is, simply, predicting Y from X (also, the correlation between X and Y: fitXY &lt;- lm(Y ~ X, data = Data) summary(fitXY) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Y ~ X, data = Data) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -3.2631 -0.8288 0.0902 0.9637 3.5891 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Using the lavaan package (v 0.6-7) in R, coefficients for each path, the indirect effect, and total effects were calculated. These values are presented in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1. Results suggested that 32.97% of the variance in M and 40.96% of the variance in Y were accounted for in the model. The indirect effect (\\(B\\) = 0.529, \\(p\\) = 0.000) was statistically significant; the direct effect (\\(B\\) = -0.209, \\(p\\) = 0.062) was not. Comparing the nonsignificant direct effect to the statistically significant total effect (\\(B\\) = 0.321, \\(p\\) = 0.010) is consistent with the notion that the effect of X on Y is explained through M. 6.5 Research Vignette The research vignette comes from the Kim, Kendall, and Cheons (2017), Racial Microaggressions, Cultural Mistrust, and Mental Health Outcomes Among Asian American College Students. Participants were 156 Asian American undergraduate students in the Pacific Northwest. The researchers posited the a priori hypothesis that cultural mistrust would mediate the relationship between racial microaggressions and two sets of outcomes: mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety, well-being) and help-seeking. Variables used in the study included: REMS: Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Scale (Nadal, 2011). The scale includes 45 items on a 2-point scale where 0 indicates no experience of a microaggressive event and 1 indicates it was experienced at least once within the past six months. Higher scores indicate more experience of microaggressions. CMI: Cultural Mistrust Inventory (Terrell &amp; Terrell, 1981). This scale was adapted to assess cultural mistrust harbored among Asian Americans toward individuals from the mainstream U.S. culture (e.g., Whites). The CMI includes 47 items on a 7-point scale where higher scores indicate a higher degree of cultural mistrust. ANX, DEP, PWB: Subscales of the Mental Health Inventory (Veit &amp; Ware, 1983) that assess the mental health outcomes of anxiety (9 items), depression (4 items), and psychological well-being (14 items). Higher scores (on a 6 point scale) indicate stronger endorsement of the mental health outcome being assessed. HlpSkg: The Attiudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help  Short Form (Fischer &amp; Farina, 1995) includes 10 items on a 4-point scale (0 = disagree, 3 = agree) where higher scores indicate more favorable attitudes toward help seeking. 6.5.1 Simulate Data from the Journal Article First, we simulate the data from the means, standard deviations, and correlation matrix from the journal article. #Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from the journal article mu &lt;- c(.34, 3.00, 2.98, 2.36, 3.50, 1.64) sd &lt;- c(.16, .83, .99, .90, .90, .53) r_mat &lt;- matrix (c(1, .59, .26, .34, -.25, -.02, .59, 1.00, .12, .19, -.28, .00, .26, .12, 1.00, .66, -.55, .07, .34, .19, .66, 1.00, -.66, .05, -.25, -.28, -.55,-.66, 1.00, .08, -.02, .00, .07, .05, .08, 1), ncol = 6) #Creating a covariance matrix cov_mat &lt;- sd %*% t(sd) * r_mat #Set random seed so that the following matrix always gets the same results. set.seed(210409) library(MASS) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;MASS&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:formattable&#39;: ## ## area ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:dplyr&#39;: ## ## select Kim_df &lt;- mvrnorm(n = 156, mu=mu, Sigma = cov_mat, empirical = TRUE) colMeans(Kim_df) ## [1] 0.34 3.00 2.98 2.36 3.50 1.64 #Checking our work against the original correlation matrix round(cor(Kim_df),3) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1.00 0.59 0.26 0.34 -0.25 -0.02 ## [2,] 0.59 1.00 0.12 0.19 -0.28 0.00 ## [3,] 0.26 0.12 1.00 0.66 -0.55 0.07 ## [4,] 0.34 0.19 0.66 1.00 -0.66 0.05 ## [5,] -0.25 -0.28 -0.55 -0.66 1.00 0.08 ## [6,] -0.02 0.00 0.07 0.05 0.08 1.00 #look at the first 6 rows of the new df head(Kim_df) ## REMS CMI ANX DEP PWB HlpSk ## 1 0.5632213 3.659748 4.104905 1.955481 3.287428 1.918057 ## 2 0.4164574 2.405398 3.189049 1.574824 4.250802 1.701437 ## 3 0.2823777 1.822439 3.820871 2.515103 3.272359 1.342201 ## 4 0.3301192 4.877980 3.298069 2.219149 3.310993 1.450270 ## 5 0.2119648 2.110152 3.068806 2.145528 3.429861 1.909203 ## 6 0.5961068 4.087986 3.420916 3.129796 2.914344 1.900283 Lets check the descriptives to see if they align with those in the article. library(psych) psych::describe(Kim_df) ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis ## REMS 1 156 0.34 0.16 0.32 0.34 0.16 -0.12 0.77 0.89 -0.02 -0.01 ## CMI 2 156 3.00 0.83 3.01 3.00 0.73 0.90 5.42 4.51 -0.01 0.07 ## ANX 3 156 2.98 0.99 2.98 2.98 0.88 0.32 5.53 5.21 -0.04 0.17 ## DEP 4 156 2.36 0.90 2.41 2.37 0.90 -0.24 4.73 4.96 -0.11 -0.17 ## PWB 5 156 3.50 0.90 3.52 3.50 0.85 1.16 6.48 5.32 0.01 0.22 ## HlpSk 6 156 1.64 0.53 1.69 1.66 0.53 -0.07 2.90 2.97 -0.36 0.28 ## se ## REMS 0.01 ## CMI 0.07 ## ANX 0.08 ## DEP 0.07 ## PWB 0.07 ## HlpSk 0.04 There are a number of reasons I love the Kim et al. (2017) manuscript. One is that their approach was openly one that tested alternate models. Byrne (2016) credits Joreskog (Joreskog, 1993) with classifying the researchers model testing approach in three ways. If someone is strictly confirmatory, they only test the model they proposed and then accept or reject it without further alteration. While this is the tradition of null hypothesis significance testing, it contributes to the file drawer problem of unpublished, non-significant, findings. Additionally, the data are them discarded  potentially losing valuable resource. The alternative models approach is to propose a handful of competing models before beginning the analysis and then evaluating to see if one model is superior to the other. The third option is model generating. In this case the researcher begins with a theoretically proposed model. In the presence of poor fit, the researcher seeks to identify the source of misfit  respecifying it to best represent the sample data. The researcher must use caution to produce a model that fits well and is meaningful. Several of the Kim et al. (2017) models were non-significant. To demonstrate a model that is statistically significant, I will test the hypothesis that racial microaggressions (REMS, the X variable) influence depression (DEP, the Y variable) through cultural mistrust (CMI, the M variable).

They dont: CI95 -1.443 to 0.032 the direct effect (c, c prime, or c_p) is the isolated effect of X on Y when including M. We hope this value is LOWER than the total effect because this means that including M shared some of the variance in predicting Y: c = -0.732, \\(p\\) = 0.151, and it is no longer signifcant. we also see the total effect; this value is identical to the value of simply predicting Y on X (with no M it the model) the value of a(b) + c_p: 3.061(-0.220) + -0.732 = -1.406 (\\(p\\) = 0.000) 6.5.4 A Figure and a Table I make it a practice to immediately plot what I did.

For me, it facilitates my conceptual understanding of (a) what the statistic is doing and (b) the results of our specific data.

These values are presented in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1. Results suggested that 34.81% of the variance in cultural mistrust and 8.94%of the variance in depression were accounted for by the model. When the mediator was included in the model, bias-corrected confidence intervals surrounding the indirect effect (\\(B\\) = -0.675, \\(p\\) = 0.066, CI95 -1.443 to 0.032) were not quite statistically significant. Consistent with mediation, the value of the total effect was larger in magnitude and statistically significant (\\(B\\) = -1.406, \\(p\\) = 0.000, CI95 -2.133 to -0.722) than the smaller and non-significant direct effect (\\(B\\) = -0.732, \\(p\\) = 0.151, CI95 -1.697 to 0.293). 6.6 Considering Covariates Hayes Chapter 4 (2018) considers the role of covariates (e.g., other variables that could account for some of the variance in the model). When previous research (or commonsense, or detractors) suggest you should include themits worth a try. If they are non-significant and/or your variables continue to explain variance over-and-above their contribution, then you have gained ground in ruling out plausible rival hypotheses and are adding to causal evidence. They are relatively easy to specify in lavaan. Just look at to where the arrows point and then write the path! Lets say we are concerned that anxiety covaries with cultural mistrust and PWB Well add it as a covariate to both.

And to also get a graphic representation of our results. The semplot package does this easily, but the figure is more statistical than conceptual and would require more tinkering for a journal article. semPaths(Kim_fit_covs, #must identiy the model you want to map what = &quot;est&quot;, #&quot;est&quot; plots the estimates, but keeps it greyscale with no fading #whatLabels = &quot;stand&quot;, #&quot;stand&quot; changes to standardized values layout = &#39;tree&#39;, rotation = 2, #together, puts predictors on left, IVs on right edge.label.cex = 1.00, #font size of parameter values #edge.color = &quot;black&quot;, #overwrites the green/black coloring sizeMan=10, #size of squares/observed/&quot;manifest&quot; variables fade=FALSE, #if TRUE, there lines are faded such that weaker lines correspond with lower values -- a cool effect, but tough for journals esize=2, asize=3, #label.prop = .5, label.font = 2.5, #controls size (I think) of font for labels label.scale = TRUE, #if false, the labels will not scale to fit inside the nodes nDigits = 3, #decimal places (default is 2) residuals = FALSE,#excludes residuals (and variances) from the path diagram nCharNodes = 0, #specifies how many characters to abbreviate variable lables; default is 3.

The Kim et al. (Paul Youngbin Kim et al., 2017) writeup is a great example. Rather than copying it directly, I have modeled my table after the ones in Hayes (2018) text. Youll notice that information in the table and text are minimally overlapping. APA style cautions us against redundancy in text and table. Results A simple mediation model examined the degree to which cultural mistrust mediated the effect of racial microaggressions on psychological well-being. Using the lavaan package (v 0.6-7) in R, coefficients for the each path, the indirect effect, and total effects were calculated. The effect of covariate, anxiety, was mapped onto both the mediator and dependent variable. These values are presented in Table 3 and illustrated in Figure 3. Results suggested that 34.93% of the variance in cultural mistrust and 34.93% of the variance in well-being were accounted for by the model. Supporting the notion of a mediated model, there was a statistically significant indirect effect (\\(B\\) = -0.776, \\(p\\) = 0.016, CI95 -1.486 to -0.229) in combination with a non-significant direct effect (\\(B\\) = 0.131, \\(p\\) = 0.798, CI95 -0.854 to 1.158). Curiously, though, the total effect (\\(B\\) = -0.646, \\(p\\) = 0.083, CI95 -1.392 to 0.079) was also non-significant. 6.7 Residual and Related Questions ..that you might have; or at least I had, but if had answered them earlier it would have disrupt the flow. Are you sure you can claim a significant indirect effect in the presence of a non-significant total effect? Hayes (2018) is. In the section subtitled, What about Baron &amp; Kenny (chapter 4), Hayes argues from both logical/philosophical and statistical perspectives that the size of the total effect does not constrain or determine the size of the indirect effect. That is, an indirect effect can be different from zero even when the total effect is not (pp. 117-119). The output we get is different from the output in the journal article being used as the research vignette. Why? And should we worry about it? We are simulating data. This gives us some advantages in that (unless we specify it), we never have missingness and our variables should be normally distributed. Because we are working from means, standard deviations, and correlations, our data will never be the same as the original researcher. That said, we can compare our results to the journal to check out work. In fact, in this very chapter, I got turned around (e.g., first accidentally swapping the mediator and IV; then using the wrong DV) and was able to compare my work against the journal article to correct my errors. Some of the statistics you are reporting are different than the ones in Hayes and the ones that use the PROCESS macro (e.g., what happened to the F test)? The default estimator for lavaan is maximum likelihood (ML) and Hayes uses ordinary least squares (OLS). This affects both the values of coefficients, standard errors, AND the type of statistics that are reported. You can ask for OLS regression by adding the statement estimator =GLS\". Even with this option, I have not discovered a way to obtain the F tests for the overall model. Researchers seem to be comfortable with this, even asking for less than we did (e.g., many do not request R square). Best I can tell, researchers who do want this might use a combination of packages, using GLS estimators in lavaan (this easily gets them the bootstrapped CIs) and the move to a different regression package to get the intercepts and F tests. If I did this I would triple check to make sure that all the output really lined up. Why did we ignore the traditional fit statistics associated with structural equation modeling (e.g., CFI, RMSEA). I hesitate to do this with models that do not include latent variables. Therefore, we asked for an in-between amount of info that should be sufficient for publication submission (any editor may have their own preferences and ask for more). What if I have missing data? When we enter the lavaan world we do get options other than multiple imputation. In todays example we used the sem fitting function. Unless otherwise specified, listwise deletion (deleting the entire case when one of its variables is used to estimate the model) is the default in lavaan. If data are MCAR or MAR, you can add the argument missing = ml (or its alias missing = fiml). More here https://users.ugent.be/~yrosseel/lavaan/lavaan2.pdf on the 1.7/Missing data in lavaan slide. That said, the type of estimator matters. If you estimate your data with GLS (generalized least squares) or WLS (weighted least squares), you are required to have complete data (however you got it). We used maximum likelihood and, even though we had non-missing data, I used the missing = fiml code. 6.8 Practice Problems The three problems described below are designed to grow with the subsequent chapters on complex mediation and conditional process analysis (i.e,. moderated mediation). Therefore, I recommend that you select a dataset that includes at least four variables. If you are new to this topic, you may wish to select variables that are all continuously scaled. The IV and moderator (subsequent chapters) could be categorical (if they are dichotomous, please use 0/1 coding; if they have more than one category it is best if they are ordered). You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis. The suggested practice problem for this chapter is to conduct a simple mediation. 6.8.1 Problem #1: Rework the research vignette as demonstrated, but change the random seed If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation, then rework the problem. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar. Assignment Component 1.

In these models with greater complexity we look at both parallel and serial mediation. There is also more elaboration on some of the conceptual issues related to the estimation of indirect effects. 7.1 Navigating this Lesson There is about 1 hour and 20 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional two hours. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OERs introduction 7.1.1 Learning Objectives Learning objectives from this lecture include the following: Define epiphenomality and explain how it is related to (and supports the notion of) multiple mediation. Distinguish between parallel and serial mediation models. Locate and interpret lavaan output from multiply mediated models including identifying coefficients, percentage of variance accounted for, all the effects (total, direct, indirec. total indirect), contrasts. Explain the limitations of the classic approach (Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986) to mediation. 7.1.2 Planning for Practice The suggestions for practice in this chapter include conducting parallel, serial, and/or mediation models. Options of graded complexity could incude: Rework the problem in the chapter by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data. This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar. There are a number of variables in the dataset that sourced the research vignettes for this and the prior chapter on simple mediation. Swap out one or more variables in a parallel or serial (or both) model. Conduct a parallel or serial (or both) mediation with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article. 7.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s).

Hayes (2018) identified four reasons to consider multiply mediated models: We are generally interested in MULTIPLE mechanisms A mechanism (such as a mediator) in the model, might, itself be mediated (i.e., mediated mediation) Epiphenomenality (unknown confounds): a proposed mediator could be related to an outcome not because it causes the outcome, but because it is correlated with another variable that is causally influencing the outcome. This is a noncausal alternative explanation for an association. Including multiple mediators allows formal comparison of the strength of the mediating mechanisms. There are two multiple mediator models that we will consider: parallel, serial. 7.3 Parallel Mediation Parallel multiple mediation: An antecedent variable X is modeled as influencing consequent Y directly as well as indirectly through two or more mediators, with the condition that no mediator causally influences another (Hayes, 2018, p. 149) With multiple mediation we introduce additional effects: Direct effect, \\(c&#39;\\) (this is not new) quantifies how much two cases that differ by a unit on X are estimated to differ on Y  independent of all mediators. Specific indirect effect, \\(a_{i}b_{i}\\), the individual mediated effects Total indirect effects , \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{k}a_{i}b_{i}\\) the sum of the values of the specific indirect effects. The total indirect effect can also be calculated by subtracting the direct effects from the total effects: \\(c - c&#39;\\) Total effect of X on Y, \\(c = c&#39; + \\sum_{i=1}^{k}a_{i}b_{i}\\) (also not new) the sum of the direct and indirect effects. The total effect can also be estimated by regressing Y on X alone. Contrasts allow us to directly compare separate mediating effects to see if one indirect effect is stronger than the other. In this parallel model, we can describe these effects this way: Direct effect: The effect of IV on the DV, accounting for two mediators (indirect effects) in the model. Specific indirect effects: There are indirect (or mediating) paths from the IV to the DV; through M1 and M2, respectively. Total indirect effect of X on Y: A sum of the value of indirect effects through the specific indirect effects (M1 and M2). Total effect: The sum of the direct and indirect effects. Also calculated by regressing Y (dependent variable) on X (independent variable) alone, without any other variables in the model. Recall that for a complex mediation to be parallel, there can be no causal links between mediators. This is true in this example. As before, lets work a mechanical example with simulated data that assures a statistically significant outcome. Credit to this example is from the PAULOTOFFANIN website (Toffanin, 2017). 7.3.1 A Mechanical Example We can bake our own data by updating the script we used in simple mediation to add a second mediator. 7.3.1.1 Data Simulation # Concerned that identical variable names across book chapters may be problematic, I&#39;m adding &quot;p&quot; in front the &quot;Data&quot; variable. set.seed(210417) X &lt;- rnorm(100) M1 &lt;- 0.5*X + rnorm(100) M2 &lt;- -0.35*X + rnorm(100) Y &lt;- 0.7*M2 + 0.48*M1 + rnorm(100) pData &lt;- data.frame(X = X, Y = Y, M1 = M1, M2 = M2) Using what we learned in conducting a simple mediation in lavaan, we can look at the figure of our proposed model and backwardstrace the paths to write the code. Remember The model exists between 2 single quotation marks (the odd looking  and  at the beginning and end). You can write the Y as I have done in the R chunk below, or you can write the Y separately from each arrow, such as Y ~ b1*M1 Y ~ b2*M2 Y ~ c_p*X Everything else transfers from our simple mediation, remember that the asterisk (\"*\") allows us to assign labels (a1, a2, b1, b2, etc.) to the paths; these are helpful for intuitive interpretation that eyes/nose notation (:=) is used when creating a new variable that is a function of variables in the model, but not in the dataset (i.e., the a and b path). in traditional mediation speak, the direct path from X to Y is c (c prime) and the total effect of X to Y (with nothing else in the model) is just c. Hence the c_p label for c prime. Something new: the contrast statement (only one in this example, but you could have more) allows us to compare the indirect effects to each other. We specify it in the lavaan model, but then need to test it in a subsequent set of script. Note: In the online example, the writer adds code to correlate M1 and M2. This didnt/doesnt seem right to me and then, later, when we amend it to be a serial model, it made even less sense to have them be correlated. 7.3.1.2 Specifying lavaan code library(lavaan) set.seed(210418) parallel_med &lt;- &#39; Y ~ b1*M1 + b2*M2 + c_p*X M1 ~ a1*X M2 ~ a2*X indirect1 := a1 * b1 indirect2 := a2 * b2 contrast := indirect1 - indirect2 total_indirects := indirect1 + indirect2 total_c := c_p + (indirect1) + (indirect2) direct := c_p &#39; parallel_fit &lt;- sem(parallel_med, data = pData, se = &quot;bootstrap&quot;, missing = &#39;fiml&#39;, bootstrap = 1000) pfit_sum &lt;- summary(parallel_fit, standardized = TRUE, rsq=T, fit=TRUE, ci=TRUE) ##

Especially with Hayes (2018) PROCESS macro, there is a great deal of emphasis on the use of bootstrapped confidence intervals to determine the statistical significance of the indirect effects. In fact, PROCESS output has (at least historically) not provided \\(p\\) values with the indirect effects. This is because, especially in the ordinary least squares context, bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals are more powerful (i.e., they are more likely to support a statistically significant result) than \\(p\\) values. An excellent demonstration of this phenomena was provided by Mallinckrodt et al. (2006) where they compared confidence intervals produced by the normal theory method to those that are bias corrected. The bias corrected intervals were more powerful to determining if there were statistically significant indirect effects. The method we have specified in lavaan produced bias-corrected confidence intervals. The \\(p\\) values and corresponding confidence intervals should be consistent with each other. That is, if \\(p\\) &lt; .05, then the CI95s should not pass through zero. Of course we can always check to be certain this is true. For this reason, I will report \\(p\\) values in my results. There are reviewers, though, who may prefer that you report CI95s (or both). 7.3.1.4 Figures and Tables library(semTable) Tb1FDataparallel &lt;- semTable(parallel_fit, columns = c(&quot;est&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;rsquare&quot;), columnLabels = c(eststars = &quot;Estimate&quot;), paramSets = c(&quot;composites&quot;, &quot;loadings&quot;, &quot;slopes&quot;, &quot;intercepts&quot;, &quot;residualvariances&quot;), file = &quot;Tb1FakyDataparallel&quot;, type = &quot;csv&quot;, print.results = TRUE) library(semPlot) #note change in layout semPaths(parallel_fit, #must identiy the model you want to map what = &quot;est&quot;, #&quot;est&quot; plots the estimates, but keeps it greyscale with no fading #whatLabels = &quot;stand&quot;, #&quot;stand&quot; changes to standardized values #layout = &#39;tree&#39;, rotation = 2, #together, puts predictors on left, IVs on right layout = &#39;spring&#39;, edge.label.cex = 1.00, #font size of parameter values #edge.color = &quot;black&quot;, #overwrites the green/black coloring sizeMan=10, #size of squares/observed/&quot;manifest&quot; variables fade=FALSE, #if TRUE, there lines are faded such that weaker lines correspond with lower values -- a cool effect, but tough for journals esize=2, asize=3, #label.prop = .5, label.font = 2.5, #controls size (I think) of font for labels label.scale = TRUE, #if false, the labels will not scale to fit inside the nodes nDigits = 3, #decimal places (default is 2) residuals = FALSE,#excludes residuals (and variances) from the path diagram nCharNodes = 0, #specifies how many characters to abbreviate variable lables; default is 3.

You might be surprised to learn that a number of articles that analyze mediating effects focus their presentation on those values and not the traditional intercepts and B weights. This is the approach I have taken in this chapter.

X =definition; M1 = definition; M2 = definition; Y = definition. The significance of the indirect effects was calculated with bias-corrected confidence intervals (.95) bootstrap analysis. 7.3.1.5 APA Style Writeup A model of parallel multiple mediation was analyzed examining the degree to which importance of M1 and M2 mediated the relation of X on Y. Hayes (2018) recommended this strategy over simple mediation models because it allows for all mediators to be examined, simultaneously. The resultant direct and indirect values for each path account for other mediation paths. Using the lavaan (v. 0.6-7) package in R, coefficients for specific indirect, total indirect, direct, and total were computed. Path coefficients refer to regression weights, or slopes, of the expected changes in the dependent variable given a unit change in the independent variables. Results (depicted in Figure 1 and presented in Table 2) suggest that 45.77% of the variance in Y is accounted for by the model. While each of the specific indirect effects (X through M1 and M2, respectively) were statistically significant, the total indirect effect (i.e., the sum of the specific indirect effects was not. This is likely because the indirect effect passing through M1 was positive in valence and the indirect effect passing through M2 was negative; hence, they cancelled each other out. A pairwise comparison of the specific indirect effects indicated that the strength of the effects were statistically significantly different from each other (\\(B\\) = 0.509, \\(p\\) = 0.000). This means that the indirect effect passing through M1 was statistically stronger than the indirect effect passing through M2. Lets turn now to the research vignette and work an example with simulated data from that example. Because the research vignette use an entirely new set of output I will either restart R or clear my environment so that there are a few less objects in the way. 7.3.2 Research Vignette The research vignette comes from the Lewis, Williams, Peppers, and Gadsons (2017) study titled, Applying Intersectionality to Explore the Relations Between Gendered Racism and Health Among Black Women. The study was published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology. Participants were 231 Black women who completed an online survey. Variables used in the study included: GRMS: Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale (J. A. Lewis &amp; Neville, 2015) is a 26-item scale that assesses the frequency of nonverbal, verbal, and behavioral negative racial and gender slights experienced by Black women. Scaling is along six points ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (once a week or more). Higher scores indicate a greater frequency of gendered racial microaggressions. An example item is, Someone has made a sexually inappropriate comment about my butt, hips, or thighs. MntlHlth and PhysHlth: Short Form Health Survey - Version 2 (Ware et al., 1995) is a 12-item scale used to report self-reported mental (six items) and physical health (six items). Higher scores indicate higher mental health (e.g., little or no psychological ldistress) and physical health (e.g., little or no reported symptoms in physical functioning). An example of an item assessing mental health was, How much of the time during the last 4 weeks have you felt calm and peaceful?; an example of a physical health item was, During the past 4 weeks, how much did pain interfere with your normal work? Sprtlty, SocSup, Engmgt, and DisEngmt are four subscales from the Brief Coping with Problems Experienced Inventory (Carver, 1997). The 28 items on this scale are presented on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (I usually do not do this at all) to 4(I usually do this a lot). Higher scores indicate a respondents tendency to engage in a particular strategy. Instructions were modified to ask how the female participants responded to recent experiences of racism and sexism as Black women. The four subscales included spirituality (religion, acceptance, planning), interconnectedness/social support (vent emotions, emotional support,instrumental social support), problem-oriented/engagement coping (active coping, humor, positive reinterpretation/positive reframing), and disengagement coping (behavioral disengagement, substance abuse, denial, self-blame, self-distraction). GRIcntlty: The Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity Centrality subscale (Sellers et al., n.d.) was modified to measure the intersection of racial and gender identity centrality. The scale included 10 items scaled from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). An example item was, Being a Black woman is important to my self-image. Higher scores indicated higher levels of gendered racial identity centrality. 7.3.2.1 Data Simulation Simulating the data: #Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from the journal article mu &lt;- c(1.99, 2.82, 2.48, 2.32, 1.75, 5.71, 21.37, 21.07) sd &lt;- c(.90, .70, .81, .61, .53, 1.03, 3.83, 4.66) r_mat &lt;- matrix (c(1, .20, .28, .30, .41, .19, -.32, -.18, .20, 1, .49, .57, .22, .13, -.06, -.13, .28, .49, 1, .46, .26, .38, -.18,-.08, .30, .57, .46, 1, .37, .08, -.14, -.06, .41, .22, .26, .37, 1, .05, -.54, -.28, .19, .13, .38, .08, .05, 1, -.10, .14, -.32, -.06, -.18, -.14, -.54, -.10, 1, .47, -.18, -.13, -.08, -.06, -.28, .14, .47, 1), ncol = 8) #Creating a covariance matrix cov_mat &lt;- sd %*% t(sd) * r_mat cov_mat ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] ## [1,] 0.81000 0.12600 0.204120 0.164700 0.195570 0.176130 -1.103040 ## [2,] 0.12600 0.49000 0.277830 0.243390 0.081620 0.093730 -0.160860 ## [3,] 0.20412 0.27783 0.656100 0.227286 0.111618 0.317034 -0.558414 ## [4,] 0.16470 0.24339 0.227286 0.372100 0.119621 0.050264 -0.327082 ## [5,] 0.19557 0.08162 0.111618 0.119621 0.280900 0.027295 -1.096146 ## [6,] 0.17613 0.09373 0.317034 0.050264 0.027295 1.060900 -0.394490 ## [7,] -1.10304 -0.16086 -0.558414 -0.327082 -1.096146 -0.394490 14.668900 ## [8,] -0.75492 -0.42406 -0.301968 -0.170556 -0.691544 0.671972 8.388466 ## [,8] ## [1,] -0.754920 ## [2,] -0.424060 ## [3,] -0.301968 ## [4,] -0.170556 ## [5,] -0.691544 ## [6,] 0.671972 ## [7,] 8.388466 ## [8,] 21.715600 #Set random seed so that the following matrix always gets the same results. set.seed(210403) library(MASS) Lewis_df &lt;- mvrnorm(n = 212, mu=mu, Sigma = cov_mat, empirical = TRUE) colMeans(Lewis_df) ## [1] 1.99 2.82 2.48 2.32 1.75 5.71 21.37 21.07 #Checking our work against the original correlation matrix cor(Lewis_df) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] ## [1,] 1.00 0.20 0.28 0.30 0.41 0.19 -0.32 -0.18 ## [2,] 0.20 1.00 0.49 0.57 0.22 0.13 -0.06 -0.13 ## [3,] 0.28 0.49 1.00 0.46 0.26 0.38 -0.18 -0.08 ## [4,] 0.30 0.57 0.46 1.00 0.37 0.08 -0.14 -0.06 ## [5,] 0.41 0.22 0.26 0.37 1.00 0.05 -0.54 -0.28 ## [6,] 0.19 0.13 0.38 0.08 0.05 1.00 -0.10 0.14 ## [7,] -0.32 -0.06 -0.18 -0.14 -0.54 -0.10 1.00 0.47 ## [8,] -0.18 -0.13 -0.08 -0.06 -0.28 0.14 0.47 1.00 Rename the variables as.data.frame(Lewis_df, row.names = NULL, optional = FALSE, make.names = TRUE) library(tidyverse) Lewis_df &lt;- Lewis_df%&gt;% as.data.frame %&gt;% rename(GRMS = V1, Sprtlty = V2, SocSup = V3, Engmt = V4, DisEngmt = V5, GRIcntlty = V6, MtnlHlth = V7, PhysHlth = V8) head(Lewis_df) ## GRMS Sprtlty SocSup Engmt DisEngmt GRIcntlty MtnlHlth PhysHlth ## 1 1.6527393 2.022990 1.705523 1.360615 1.0830779 5.517213 22.75649 19.41684 ## 2 0.7640948 1.644033 2.505362 2.242470 1.7132075 5.413544 22.62540 22.26355 ## 3 2.0107291 2.321768 2.660635 2.004928 1.5158907 4.842883 19.07803 23.23430 ## 4 1.2409552 1.920184 1.470588 1.096715 1.4677302 4.124888 23.94831 18.74295 ## 5 1.4613106 3.775331 2.939616 1.825157 0.9183584 5.558731 22.77763 18.81243 ## 6 3.3326679 2.432105 2.709137 2.427134 1.7561275 8.816758 19.26199 24.46558 7.3.2.2 Quick Descriptives Of course it is is a good idea to examine our data ahead of time.

Because we asked for a normal distribution, we do not violate any of the assumptions related to univariate normality; our skew and kurtosis are well within the limits. The pairs panel from the psych package is an efficient way to see the distribution of each variable with a normal curve superimposed (on the diagonal) the value of the bivariate correlation (upper diagonal) a scatterplot with a regression line between each pair of variables (lower diagonal) psych::pairs.panels(Lewis_df) The Lewis et al. article (2017) reports four mediation analyses, each repeated for mental and physical outcomes. Thus, their write-up reports eight simple mediation models. Graphically, this is efficiently represented in a figure that looks like parallel mediation. Note that the figure is reporting standardized estimates. In Hayes (2018) we have been using raw, \\(B\\) weights. However, the standardized weights are reported in the output. Because the figure looked like a parallel mediation, it made sense to me that we could try this in our research vignette. In the chapter on conditional process analysis, we will work the moderated mediation as they have done. Below is the model we will work. Specifically, we will evaluate whether gendered racial microaggressions impact mental health separately, thorough mediated paths of engagement and disengagement. We will also be able to see if the strength of those mediated paths are statistically, significantly, different from each other. An image of the parallel mediation we will work 7.3.2.3 Specifying the lavaan model We can use the guidelines above to specify our model and then request summaries of the fit indices and parameter estimates. set.seed(210403) library(lavaan) parallel_Lewis &lt;- &#39; MtnlHlth ~ b1*Engmt + b2*DisEngmt + c_p*GRMS Engmt ~ a1*GRMS DisEngmt ~ a2*GRMS indirect1 := a1 * b1 indirect2 := a2 * b2 contrast := indirect1 - indirect2 total_indirects := indirect1 + indirect2 total_c := c_p + (indirect1) + (indirect2) direct := c_p &#39; para_Lewis_fit &lt;- sem(parallel_Lewis, data = Lewis_df, se = &quot;bootstrap&quot;, bootstrap = 1000, missing = &#39;fiml&#39;) #holds the &quot;whole&quot; result pLewis_sum &lt;- summary(para_Lewis_fit , standardized = TRUE, rsq=T, fit=TRUE, ci=TRUE) #today, we really only need the R-squared from here pLewis_ParEsts &lt;- parameterEstimates(para_Lewis_fit, boot.ci.type = &quot;bca.simple&quot;, standardized=TRUE) #provides our estimates, se, p values for all the elements we specified pLewis_sum ##

IV = gendered racial microaggressions; M1 = engagement coping; M2 = disengagement coping; Y = mental health. The significance of the indirect effects was calculated with bias-corrected confidence intervals (.95) bootstrap analysis. The model accounts for 32.64% of the variance in predicting mental health outcomes. The total effect of GRMS on mental health is -1.362 (\\(p\\) = 0.000) is negative and statistically significant. That is, gendered racial microaggressions have a statistically significant negative effect on mental health. The direct effect of GRMS on mental health is -0.575 (p = 0.269) is still negative but not statistically significant. Using Baron and Kennys (1986) causal steps logic, the smaller and non-significant direct effect (compared to the total effect) provides helpful, logical support for mediation. According to Hayes (2018) this difference is not necessary. However it is logically helpful. Indirect effect #1 (a1 x b1 or GRMS through engagement coping) is 0.118 (\\(p\\) = 0.000) and not statistically significant. Looking at the paths we see that a1 is positive and statistically significant (GRMS leds to increased engagement coping), but the next link, b1 (engagement to mental health) is not statistically significant. Indirect effect #2 (a2 x b2, or GRMS through disengagement to coping) is -0.905(\\(p\\) = 0.000). Gendered racial microaggressions lead to greater disengagement (a1). In turn, disengagement has negative effects on mental health (b2) The total indirect effect (i.e., sum of M1 and M2) -0.787 (\\(p\\) = 0.000 ) The sum of all specific indirect effects; statistically significant. We look at the contrast to see if the indirect effects statistically significantly different from each other? \\(B\\) = 1.023, \\(p\\) = 0.000. They are. This is not surprising since the path mediated by engagement was not statistically significant but the path mediated by disengagement was statistically significant.

Here is a summary of his recommendations. Pack as much statistical info as possible into a table(s) or figure (s). Use statistics in the text as punctuation; avoid redundancy in text and table. Avoid using abbreviations for variables in the text itself; rather focus on the construct names rather than their shorthand Avoid focusing on what you hypothesized (e.g., avoid, Results supported/did not support hypothesis A1) and instead focus on what you found. The reader is more interested in the results, not your forecasts. Hayes uses unstandardized metrics. He prefers reporting unstandardized metrics because they map onto the measurement scales used in the study. He believes this is especially important when dichotomous variables are used. There is no harm in reporting hypothesis tests and CIs for the a and b paths, but whether/not these paths are statistically significant does not determine the significance of the indirect effect. Be precise with language: OK: X exerts an effect on Y directly and/or indirectly through M. Not OK: the indirect effect of M Report direct and indirect effects and their corresponding inferential tests Hayes argues that a statistically significant indirect effect is, in fact statistic. He dislikes narration of the Baron and Kenny (1986) process and steps. Heres my attempt to write up the simulated data from the Lewis et al. (2017) article. Method Data Analysis Parallel multiple mediation is appropriate when testing the influence of an independent variable (X) on the dependent variable (Y) directly, as well as indirectly through two or more mediators. A condition of parallel multiple mediation is that no mediator causally influences another (Hayes, 2018). Using data simulated from Lewis et al. (2017) we utilized parallel multiple mediation analysis to test the influence of gendered racial microaggressions (X, GRMS) on mental health outcomes (Y, MntlHlth) directly as well as indirectly through the mediators engagement coping (M1, Engmt) and disengaged coping (M2, DisEngmt). Using the lavaan (v. 0.6-7) package in R we followed the procedures outlined in Hayes (2018) by analyzing the strength and significance of four sets of effects: specific indirect, the total indirect, the direct, and total. Results Preliminary Analyses Descriptive statistics were computed, and all variables were assessed for skewness and kurtosis. More narration,here. A summary of descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix for the study is provided in Table #. These bivariate relations provide evidence to support the test of mediation analysis. Parallel Multiple Mediation Analysis A model of parallel multiple mediation was analyzed examining the degree to which engagement and disengagement coping strategies mediated the relation of gendered racial microaggressions on mental health outcomes in Black women. Hayes (2018) recommended this strategy over simple mediation models because it allows for all mediators to be examined, simultaneously. The resultant direct and indirect values for each path account for other mediation paths. Using the lavaan (v. 0.6-7) package in R, coefficients for specific indirect, total indirect, direct, and total were computed. Path coefficients refer to regression weights, or slopes, of the expected changes in the dependent variable given a unit change in the independent variables. Results (depicted in Figure # and presented in Table #) suggest that 32.64% of the variance in mental health outcomes is accounted for by the three variables in the model. The indirect effect predicting mental health from gendered racial microaggressions via engagement coping was not statistically significant (\\(B\\) = 0.118, \\(p\\) = 0.000). Looking at the individual paths we see that \\(a_{1}\\) was positive and statistically significant (GRMS leds to increased engagement coping), but the subsequent link, \\(b_{1}\\) (engagement to mental health) was not. The indirect effect predicting mental health from gendered racial microaggressions through disengagement to coping was statistically significant (\\(B\\) = -0.905, \\(p\\) = 0.000). In this case, gendered racial microaggressions led to greater disengagement coping (\\(a_{2}\\)). In turn, disengagement coping had negative effects on mental health (\\(b_{2}\\)). Correspondingly, the total indirect effect (i.e., the sum of the specific indirect effects was statistically significant. A pairwise comparison of the specific indirect effects indicated that the strength of the effects were statistically significantly different from each other (\\(B\\) = 1.023, \\(p\\) = 0.000). Given that the path through engagement coping was not significant, but the path through disengagement coping was, this statistically signifciant difference is not surprising. Further support for understanding mediation as the mechanism of change is found in the drop in statistical significance from the total effect (c) to the direct effect (c). Hints for Writing Method/Results Sections When you find an article you like, make note of it and put it in a very special folder. In recent years, I have learned to rely on full-text versions stored in my Zotero app. Once you know your method (measure, statistic, etc.) begin collecting others articles that are similar to it. To write results sections I will often reference multiple articles. When it iss time to write have all these resources handy and use them as guides/models. Put as much info as possible in the table. Become a table-pro. That is, learn how to merge/split cells, use borders/shading, the decimal tab, and so forth. Dont make the borders disappear until the last thing you do before submitting. This is because you ALWAYS have to update your tables and seeing the borders makes it easier. 7.4 Serial Multiple Mediator Model Recall that one of the conditions of the parallel mediator model was that no mediator causally influences another. Regarding these correlated mediators (2018): Typically, two or more mediators that are causally located between X and Y will be correlated - if for no other reason than that they share a common cause (X). Estimating the partial correlation between two mediators after controlling for X is one way to examine whether all of their association is accounted for by this common cause. Partial correlation is the Pearson correlation between the residuals from a model estimating Y from a set of covariates, and the residuals from a model estimating X from the same set of covariates. Partial correlations allow the assessment of their association, independent of what they have in common with the covariates that were regressed onto Y and X, separately. If two (or more) mediators remain correlated after adjusting for X, then the correlation is spurious, they share another (unmodeled) common cause. the remaining association is epiphenomenal. That is, a proposed mediator could be related to an outcome not because it causes the outcome, but because it is correlated with another variable that is causally influencing the outcome. This is a noncausal alternative explanation for an association. Also, many things correlated with the cause of Y will also tend to be correlated with X, but it doesnt make all those things cause Y or one mediator causally affects another The goal of a serial multiple mediator model is to investigate the direct and indirect effects of X on Y while modeling a process in which X causes M1, which in turn causes M2, and so forth, concluding with Y as the final consequent. As before, we will calculate: Direct effect, c: the estimated difference in Y between two cases that differ by one unit on X but who are equal on all mediators in the model. Specific indirect effects, a1b1, a2b2, a3b3, etc.: constructed by multiplying the regression weights corresponding to each step in an indirect pathway; interpreted as the estimated difference in Y between two cases that differ by one unit on X through the causal sequence from X to mediator(s) to Y. Total indirect effect of X: sum of all specific indirect effects Total effect of X: the total indirect effect of X plus the direct effect of X; can also be estimated by regressing Y from X only. Pairwise comparisons (contrasts) between indirect effects (i.e., is one indirect effect stronger than another) 7.4.1 We stick with the Lewis et al. (2017) example, but modify it. An image of the serial mediation we will work Our parallel multiple mediator model of gendered racial microaggressions on mental health through engagement and disengagement coping strategies assumed no causal association between the mediators. Noting the statistically significant correlation between engagement and disengagement, what if engagement influenced disengagement, which, in turn influenced mental health. If this is our goal (image), how many direct and indirect effects are contained in this model? Using the same processes as before, lets plan our model: We add a path predicting disengagement from engagement, and label it with a \\(d_{21}\\) Regarding the notation, it makes sense that we use a d to designate a new type of path; I dont know why we use a subscript of 21 We specify a third indirect path that multiplies those 3 paths (a1, d21, b2) together We add a third contrast so that we get all the combinations of indirect comparisons: 1-2, 1-3 2-3 We update our total_indirects calculation to include indirect#3 We update our total_c calculation to include indirect#3 7.4.2 Specify the lavaan model set.seed(210403) library(lavaan) serial_Lewis &lt;- &#39; MtnlHlth ~ b1*Engmt + b2*DisEngmt + c_p*GRMS Engmt ~ a1*GRMS DisEngmt ~ a2*GRMS DisEngmt ~ d21*Engmt indirect1 := a1 * b1 indirect2 := a2 * b2 indirect3 := a1 * d21 * b2 contrast1 := indirect1 - indirect2 contrast2 := indirect1 - indirect3 contrast3 := indirect2 - indirect3 total_indirects := indirect1 + indirect2 + indirect3 total_c := c_p + indirect1 + indirect2 + indirect3 direct := c_p &#39; serial_Lewis_fit &lt;- sem(serial_Lewis, data = Lewis_df, se = &quot;bootstrap&quot;, missing = &#39;fiml&#39;, bootstrap = 1000) sLewis_sum &lt;- summary(serial_Lewis_fit, standardized = TRUE, rsq=T, fit=TRUE, ci=TRUE) sLewis_ParEsts &lt;- parameterEstimates(serial_Lewis_fit, boot.ci.type = &quot;bca.simple&quot;, standardized=TRUE) sLewis_sum ##

IV = gendered racial microaggressions; M1 = engagement coping; M2 = disengagement coping; Y = mental health. The significance of the indirect effects was calculated with bias-corrected confidence intervals (.95) bootstrap analysis. Working through the data, we should be able to find these items: The model accounts for 31.04% of the variance in predicting mental health outcomes. The total effect of GRMS (X) on mental health (Y) is -1.362 (\\(p\\) = 0.000) is negative and statistically significant. The direct effect of GRMS (X) on mental health (Y) (-0.575, \\(p\\) = 0.033) is still negative, but weaker in magnitude (relative to the total effect). While the \\(p\\) value is statistically significant, it is closer to being not significant (than the total effect). This reduction in magnitude and strength of significance is consistent with the Baron and Kenny (1986) logic of mediation. Indirect effect #1 (\\(a_{1}\\) x \\(b_{1}\\) or GRMS through engagement coping to mental health) is 0.118 (\\(p\\) = 0.235). Again, \\(p\\) is &gt; .05. Examining the individual paths, there is a statistically significant relationship from GRMS to engagement, but not from engagement to mental health. Indirect effect #2 (\\(a_{2}\\) x \\(b_{2}\\), or GRMS through disengagement coping to mental health, is -0.726 (\\(p\\) = 0.000). Each of the paths is statistically significant from zero and so is the indirect effect. Indirect effect #3 (\\(a_{2}\\) x \\(d_{21}\\) x \\(b_{2}\\); GRMS through engagement coping through disengagement coping to mental health) is -0.180 (\\(p\\) = 0.000). This indirect effect involves \\(a_{1}\\) (GRMS to engagement) which is not significant. However, the remaining paths were significant. That is engagement coping led to increased disengagement coping, which led to poorer mental health outcomes. Total indirect: -0.787 (\\(p\\) = 0.000) is the sum of all specific indirect effects and is statistically significant. With contrasts we ask: Are the indirect effects statistically significantly different from each other? Contrast 1 (indirect 1 v 2) = 0.844 (\\(p\\) = 0.000), yes Contrast 2 (indirect 1 v 3) = 0.844 (\\(p\\) = 0.022), yes Contrast 3 (indirect 2 v 3) = 0.844 (\\(p\\) = -0.546), yes This formal test of contrasts is an important one. It is not ok to infer that effects are statistically significantly different than each other on the basis of their estimates or \\(p\\) values. The formal test allows us to claim (with justification) that the strongest indirect effect is #2  GRMS through disengagement coping to mental health. library(semTable) LewisserialTbl &lt;- semTable(serial_Lewis_fit, columns = c(&quot;est&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;rsquare&quot;), columnLabels = c(eststars = &quot;Estimate&quot;), paramSets = c(&quot;composites&quot;, &quot;loadings&quot;, &quot;slopes&quot;, &quot;intercepts&quot;, &quot;residualvariances&quot;), file = &quot;LewisSerialTbl&quot;, type = &quot;csv&quot;, print.results = TRUE) This is not the greatest figure.

We utilized serial multiple mediation analysis to test the influence of gendered racial microaggressions (X, GRMS) on mental health (Y, MntlHlth) directly as well as indirectly through the mediators engagement coping (M1, Engmt) and disengagement coping (M2, DisEngmt). Moreover, we hypothesized a causal linkage between from the engagement coping mediator to the disengagement coping mediator such that a third specific indirect effect began with GRMS (X) through engagement coping (M1) through disengagement coping (M2) to mental health (Y). Using the lavaan (v. 0.6-7) package in R we followed the procedures outlined in Hayes (2018) by analyzing the strength and significance of four sets of effects: specific indirect, the total indirect, the direct, and total. Bootstrap analysis, a nonparametric sampling procedure, was used to test the significance of the indirect effects. Hayes would likely recommend that we say this with fewer acronyms and more words/story. Results Preliminary Analyses Descriptive statistics were computed, and all variables were assessed univariate normality. You would give your results regarding skew, kurtosis, Shapiro Wilks, here. If relevant, you could also describe multivariate normality. A summary of descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix for the study is provided in Table 1. These bivariate relations provide evidence to support the test of mediation analysis. Serial Multiple Mediation Analysis A model of serial multiple mediation was analyzed examining the degree to which engagement and disengagement coping mediated the relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health outcomes. Hayes (2018) recommended this strategy over simple mediation models because it allows for all mediators to be examined, simultaneously and allows the testing of the seriated effect of prior mediators onto subsequent ones. Using the lavaan (v. 0.6-7) package in R, coefficients for specific indirect, total indirect, direct, and total were computed. Path coefficients refer to regression weights, or slopes, of the expected changes in the dependent variable given a unit change in the independent variables. Results (depicted in Figure # and presented in Table #) suggest that 31.04% of the variance in behavioral intentions is accounted for by the three variables in the model. Two of the specific indirect effects were significant and were statistically significantly different from each other. Specifically, the effect of gendered racial microaggressions through disengagement coping to mental health (\\(B\\) = 0.118, \\(p\\) = 0.235) was stronger than the indirect effect from gendered racial microaggressions through engagement coping through disengagement coping to mental health (\\(B\\) = -0.180, \\(p\\) = 0.000). Interpreting the results suggests that, mental health outcomes are negatively impacted by gendered racial microaggressions direct and indirectly through disengagement coping. It is this latter path that has the greatest impact. Note: In a manner consistent with the Lewis et al. (2017) article, the APA Results section can be fairly short. This is especially true when a well-organized table presents the results. In fact, I oculd have left all the numbers out of this except for the \\(R^2\\) (because it was not reported in the table). 7.5 Troubleshooting and FAQs An indirect effect that was (seemingly) significant in a simple (single) mediation disappears when additional mediators are added. Correlated mediators (e.g., multicollinearity) is a likely possibility. Which is correct? Maybe both A total effect was not significant, but there is one or more statistically significant specific indirect effect Recall that a total effect equals the sum of direct and indirect effects. If one specific indirect effect is positive and another is negative, this could account for the NS total effect. If the direct effect is NS, but the indirect effects are significant, this might render the total effect NS. The indirect effects might operate differently in subpopulations (males, females). Your editor/peer reviewer/dissertation chair-or-committee member may insist that you do this the Baron &amp; Kenny way (aka the causal steps approach). Hayes 4.1 (2018) provides fabulous narration and justification for how to justify your (I believe correct) decision to just use the PROCESS (aka, bootstrapped, bias corrected, CIs )approach. My favorite line in his text reads, \" (the B&amp;K way).is still being taught and recommended by researchers who dont follow the methodology literature.\" How can I extend a mediation (only) model to include multiple Xs, Ys, or COVs? There is fabulous, fabulous narration and syntax for doing all of this in Hayes text. Of course his mechanics are in PROCESS, but lavaan is easy to use by just drawing more paths via the syntax. Well get more practice as we go along. What about effect sizes? Shouldnt we be including/reporting them? Yes! The closest thing we have reported to an effect size is \\(R^2\\), which assess proportion of variance accounted for in the M and Y variables. In PROCESS and path analysis this is still emerging. Hayes chapter 4 presents a handful of options for effect sizes beyond \\(R^2\\). 7.6 Practice Problems The three problems described below are designed to be grow in this series of chapters that begins with simple mediation and progresses through complex mediation, moderated moderation, and conditional process analysis. I recommend that you select a dataset that includes at least four variables. If you are new to this topic, you may wish to select variables that are all continuously scaled. The IV and moderator (in subsequent chapters) could be categorical (if they are dichotomous, please use 0/1 coding; if they have more than one category it is best if they are ordered). You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis. The suggested practice problem for this chapter is to conduct a parallel or serial mediation (or both). 7.6.1 Problem #1: Rework the research vignette as demonstrated, but change the random seed If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation, then rework the problem. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar. Assignment Component 1.

That is, are the effects of the indirect effect (sign, significance, strength, presence/absence) conditional on the effects of the moderator. At the outset, please note that although I rely heavily on Hayes (2018) text and materials, I am using the R package lavaan in these chapters. Very recently, Hayes has introduced a PROCESS macro for R. Because I am not yet up-to-speed on using this macro (it is not a typical R package) and because we will use lavaan for confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, I have chosen to utilize the lavaan package. A substantial difference is that the PROCESS macros use ordinary least squares and lavaan uses maximum likelihood estimators. 8.1 Navigating this Lesson There is about 1 hour and 15 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional hour and a half. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OERs introduction 8.1.1 Learning Objectives Learning objectives from this lecture include the following: Outline a process of evaluating a moderated mediation in a piecewise (Hayes, 2018) approach to model building Recognize conditional process modeling from R script. Using the R package lavaan, specify a model with indirect effects, identify and interpret B weights, p values, and CIs for total, direct, and indirect effects, calculate the total effects of X and M on Y, identify the proportion of variance accounted for in predicting M and Y. Regarding conditional indirect effects Interpret an index of moderated mediation Know the essential components of calculating an index of moderated mediation Probe a conditional indirect effect Interpret the usual things we find in regression: B/beta weights, R, \\(R^{2}\\), and figures 8.1.2 Planning for Practice The suggestions for homework are graded in complexity and, if you like, can extend from the prior chapter on simple moderation. If you choose the first or second options, you can further amend the simulated data by making further variations such as sample size. Rework the problem in the chapter by changing the random seed in the code that simulates the data. This should provide minor changes to the data, but the results will likely be very similar. There are a number of variables in the dataset. Swap out one or more variables in the moderated mediation and compare your solution to the one in the chapter (and/or oe you mimicked in the journal article). Conduct a moderated mediation with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article. 8.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s).

Conditional process analysis: used when the analytical goal is to describe and understand the conditional nature of the mechanism or mechanisms by which a variable transmits its effect on another. We are integrating moderation and mediation mechanisms together into a single integrated analytical model. Mediator: Any causal system in which at least one causal antecedent X variable is proposed as influencing an outcome Y through a intervening variable M. In this model, there are two pathways by which X can influence Y: direct effect of X on Y, and indirect effect of X on Y through M. Answers question, How does X affect Y Partitions the X-to-Y relationship into two paths of influence: direct, indirect. Indirect effect contains two components (a,b) that when multipled (a*b) yield an estimate of how much these two cases that differ by one unit on X are estimated to differ on Y through the effect of X on M, which in turn affects Y. Keywords: how, through, via, indirect effect Moderator: The effect of X on some variable Y is moderated by W if its size, sign, or strength depends on or can be predicted by W. Stated another way, W and X interact in their influence on Y. Moderators help establish the boundary conditions of an effect or the circumstances, stimuli, or type of people for which the effect is large v. small, present v. absent, positive v. negative, and so forth. Keywords: it depends, interaction effect. Why should we engage both mediators and moderators? Hayes (2018) suggest that if we have only a mediator(s) in the model that we lose information if we reduce complex responses that no doubt differ from person to person or situation to situation (p. 394). He adds that all effects are moderated by something (p. 394). Correspondingly, he recommends we add them to a mediation anlaysis. Hayes (2018) suggests that more complete (p. 395) analyses model the mechanisms at work linking X to Y (mediator[s]) while simultaneously allowing those effects to be contingent on context, circumstance, or individual difference (moderator[s]). What are conditional direct and indirect effects?. Mediation analyses produce indirect (the product of a sequence of effects that are assumed to be causal) and direct (the unique contribution of X to Y, controlling for other variables in the model) effects. These effects (the X-to-Y/direct and X-to-M-to-Y/indirect), can also be moderated. This is our quest! Figure 11.2 in Hayes text (2018) illustrates conceptually and statistically that we can specify moderation of any combination of direct and indirect paths/effects. Image of conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a path; the path between the IV and mediator Within the CPA framework we have lots of options that generally fall into two categories: Moderated mediation: when an indirect effect of X on Y through M is moderated; the mechanism represented by the X-to-M-to-Y chain of events operates to varying degrees (or not at all) for certain people or in certain contexts. Any model in which the indirect effect (a*b) changes as a function of one or more moderators. These moderators can be operating on the a, b, or c paths or any possible combination of the three X could moderate its own indirect effect on Y through M if the effect of M on Y depends on X, or The indirect effect of X on Y through M could be contingent on a fourth variable if that fourth variable W moderates one or more of the relationships in a three-variable causal system, or An indirect effect could be contingent on a moderator variable Mediated moderation: an interaction between X and some moderator W on Y is carried through a mediator M; mediated moderation analysis is simply a mediation analysis with the product of two variables serving as the causal agent of focus An interaction between a moderator W and causal agent X on outcome Y could operate through a mediator M Hayes argues that the mediated moderation hypotheses are regularly articulated and tested by scientists (2018, p. 459). He warns, though, that we should not confuse the abundance of published examples of mediated moderation anlayseswith the meaningfulness of the procedure itself (p. 460). He later adds that mediation moderation is neither interesting nor meaningful. Why? Conceptualizing a process in terms of a mediated moderation misdirects attention toward a variable in the model that actually doesnt measure anything. Most often there are moderated mediation models that are identical in equations and resulting coefficients - the difference is in the resulting attentional focus and interpretation. Hayes (2018) recommends that models proposing mediated moderation be recast in terms of moderated mediation process. Consequently, we will not work a mediated moderation, but there is an example in chapter 12. 8.2.2 Hayes (2018) Piecewise Approach to Building Models In summarizing a strategic approach for testing structural equation models, Joreskog (Joreskog, 1993) identified three scenarios: strictly confirmatory: the traditional NHST approach of proposing a single, theoretically derived, model, and after analyzing the data either rejects or fails to reject the model. No further modifications are made/allowed. alternative models: the reseacher proposes competing (also theoretically derived) models. Following analysis of a single set of empirical data, he or she selects one model as appropriate in representing the sample data. model generating: A priori, the researcher acknowledges that they may/may not find what they have theoretically proposed. So, a priori, they acknowledge that in the absence of ideal fit (which is the usual circumstance), they will proceed in an exploratory fashion to respecify/re-estimate the model. The goal is to find a model that is both substantively meaningful and statistically well-fitting. A legacy of our field is the strictly confirmatory approach. I am thrilled when I see research experts (e.g., (Byrne, 2016)) openly endorse a model building approach. In Chapter 12, Hayes (2018) demonstrates the piecewise approach to building (and understanding) a complex model. 8.3 Workflow for Moderated Mediation At this point in this OERs development, I dont have a workflow graphic developed for this statistic. However, Hayes (2018) piecewise approach to model testing/building is really the workflow. The secret is to decompose the model into its simplest moderations and mediations and analyze them separately before assembling them. When we get to the model we will analyze with this research vignette, a series of diagrams will make this more clear. Additionally, at the end of the chapter, I offer a template of R script for the popular moderated mediation (a single moderator influencin both the a and c paths). 8.4 Research Vignette Once again the research vignette comes from the Lewis, Williams, Peppers, and Gadsons (2017) study titled, Applying Intersectionality to Explore the Relations Between Gendered Racism and Health Among Black Women. The study was published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology. Participants were 231 Black women who completed an online survey. Variables used in the study included: GRMS: Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale (J. A. Lewis &amp; Neville, 2015) is a 26-item scale that assesses the frequency of nonverbal, verbal, and behavioral negative racial and gender slights experienced by Black women. Scaling is along six points ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (once a week or more). Higher scores indicate a greater frequency of gendered racial microaggressions. An example item is, Someone has made a sexually inappropriate comment about my butt, hips, or thighs. MntlHlth and PhysHlth: Short Form Health Survey - Version 2 (Ware et al., 1995) is a 12-item scale used to report self-reported mental (six items) and physical health (six items). Higher scores indicate higher mental health (e.g., little or no psychological ldistress) and physical health (e.g., little or no reported symptoms in physical functioning). An example of an item assessing mental health was, How much of the time during the last 4 weeks have you felt calm and peaceful?; an example of a physical health item was, During the past 4 weeks, how much did pain interfere with your normal work? Sprtlty, SocSup, Engmgt, and DisEngmt are four subscales from the Brief Coping with Problems Experienced Inventory (Carver, 1997). The 28 items on this scale are presented on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (I usually do not do this at all) to 4(I usually do this a lot). Higher scores indicate a respondents tendency to engage in a particular strategy. Instructions were modified to ask how the female participants responded to recent experiences of racism and sexism as Black women. The four subscales included spirituality (religion, acceptance, planning), interconnectedness/social support (vent emotions, emotional support,instrumental social support), problem-oriented/engagement coping (active coping, humor, positive reinterpretation/positive reframing), and disengagement coping (behavioral disengagement, substance abuse, denial, self-blame, self-distraction). GRIcntlty: The Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity Centrality subscale (Sellers et al., n.d.) was modified to measure the intersection of racial and gender identity centrality. The scale included 10 items scaled from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). An example item was, Being a Black woman is important to my self-image. Higher scores indicated higher levels of gendered racial identity centrality. 8.4.1 Simulating the data from the journal article First, we simulate the data from the means, standard deviations, and correlation matrix from the journal article. #Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from the journal article LEWmu &lt;- c(1.99, 2.82, 2.48, 2.32, 1.75, 5.71, 21.37, 21.07) LEWsd &lt;- c(.90, .70, .81, .61, .53, 1.03, 3.83, 4.66) LEWr_mat &lt;- matrix (c(1, .20, .28, .30, .41, .19, -.32, -.18, .20, 1, .49, .57, .22, .13, -.06, -.13, .28, .49, 1, .46, .26, .38, -.18,-.08, .30, .57, .46, 1, .37, .08, -.14, -.06, .41, .22, .26, .37, 1, .05, -.54, -.28, .19, .13, .38, .08, .05, 1, -.10, .14, -.32, -.06, -.18, -.14, -.54, -.10, 1, .47, -.18, -.13, -.08, -.06, -.28, .14, .47, 1), ncol = 8) #Creating a covariance matrix LEWcov_mat &lt;- LEWsd %*% t(LEWsd) * LEWr_mat LEWcov_mat ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] ## [1,] 0.81000 0.12600 0.204120 0.164700 0.195570 0.176130 -1.103040 ## [2,] 0.12600 0.49000 0.277830 0.243390 0.081620 0.093730 -0.160860 ## [3,] 0.20412 0.27783 0.656100 0.227286 0.111618 0.317034 -0.558414 ## [4,] 0.16470 0.24339 0.227286 0.372100 0.119621 0.050264 -0.327082 ## [5,] 0.19557 0.08162 0.111618 0.119621 0.280900 0.027295 -1.096146 ## [6,] 0.17613 0.09373 0.317034 0.050264 0.027295 1.060900 -0.394490 ## [7,] -1.10304 -0.16086 -0.558414 -0.327082 -1.096146 -0.394490 14.668900 ## [8,] -0.75492 -0.42406 -0.301968 -0.170556 -0.691544 0.671972 8.388466 ## [,8] ## [1,] -0.754920 ## [2,] -0.424060 ## [3,] -0.301968 ## [4,] -0.170556 ## [5,] -0.691544 ## [6,] 0.671972 ## [7,] 8.388466 ## [8,] 21.715600 #Set random seed so that the following matrix always gets the same results. set.seed(210403) library(MASS) Lewis_df &lt;- mvrnorm(n = 212, mu=LEWmu, Sigma = LEWcov_mat, empirical = TRUE) colMeans(Lewis_df) ## [1] 1.99 2.82 2.48 2.32 1.75 5.71 21.37 21.07 #Checking our work against the original correlation matrix cor(Lewis_df) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] ## [1,] 1.00 0.20 0.28 0.30 0.41 0.19 -0.32 -0.18 ## [2,] 0.20 1.00 0.49 0.57 0.22 0.13 -0.06 -0.13 ## [3,] 0.28 0.49 1.00 0.46 0.26 0.38 -0.18 -0.08 ## [4,] 0.30 0.57 0.46 1.00 0.37 0.08 -0.14 -0.06 ## [5,] 0.41 0.22 0.26 0.37 1.00 0.05 -0.54 -0.28 ## [6,] 0.19 0.13 0.38 0.08 0.05 1.00 -0.10 0.14 ## [7,] -0.32 -0.06 -0.18 -0.14 -0.54 -0.10 1.00 0.47 ## [8,] -0.18 -0.13 -0.08 -0.06 -0.28 0.14 0.47 1.00 Rename the variables as.data.frame(Lewis_df, row.names = NULL, optional = FALSE, make.names = TRUE) library(tidyverse) Lewis_df &lt;- Lewis_df%&gt;% as.data.frame %&gt;% rename(GRMS = V1, Sprtlty = V2, SocSup = V3, Engmgt = V4, DisEngmt = V5, GRIcntlty = V6, MntlHlth = V7, PhysHlth = V8) head(Lewis_df) ## GRMS Sprtlty SocSup Engmgt DisEngmt GRIcntlty MntlHlth PhysHlth ## 1 1.6527393 2.022990 1.705523 1.360615 1.0830779 5.517213 22.75649 19.41684 ## 2 0.7640948 1.644033 2.505362 2.242470 1.7132075 5.413544 22.62540 22.26355 ## 3 2.0107291 2.321768 2.660635 2.004928 1.5158907 4.842883 19.07803 23.23430 ## 4 1.2409552 1.920184 1.470588 1.096715 1.4677302 4.124888 23.94831 18.74295 ## 5 1.4613106 3.775331 2.939616 1.825157 0.9183584 5.558731 22.77763 18.81243 ## 6 3.3326679 2.432105 2.709137 2.427134 1.7561275 8.816758 19.26199 24.46558 8.4.2 Quick peek at the data library(psych) psych::describe(Lewis_df) ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew ## GRMS 1 212 1.99 0.90 1.97 1.99 0.80 -1.07 3.97 5.05 -0.12 ## Sprtlty 2 212 2.82 0.70 2.80 2.83 0.75 1.08 4.57 3.49 -0.10 ## SocSup 3 212 2.48 0.81 2.44 2.47 0.80 0.62 4.78 4.17 0.11 ## Engmgt 4 212 2.32 0.61 2.32 2.33 0.60 0.75 3.93 3.18 -0.14 ## DisEngmt 5 212 1.75 0.53 1.76 1.75 0.56 0.47 3.00 2.53 -0.05 ## GRIcntlty 6 212 5.71 1.03 5.64 5.68 0.95 2.72 9.56 6.84 0.37 ## MntlHlth 7 212 21.37 3.83 21.59 21.46 4.23 11.79 31.77 19.98 -0.14 ## PhysHlth 8 212 21.07 4.66 20.79 21.03 4.68 8.43 33.73 25.30 0.07 ## kurtosis se ## GRMS 0.25 0.06 ## Sprtlty -0.41 0.05 ## SocSup -0.16 0.06 ## Engmgt -0.22 0.04 ## DisEngmt -0.56 0.04 ## GRIcntlty 0.76 0.07 ## MntlHlth -0.56 0.26 ## PhysHlth -0.18 0.32 And a quick peek at a correlation matrix. library(apaTables) apa.cor.table (Lewis_df, show.conf.interval = FALSE) ## The ability to suppress reporting of reporting confidence intervals has been deprecated in this version. ## The function argument show.conf.interval will be removed in a later version. ## ## ## Means, standard deviations, and correlations with confidence intervals ## ## ## Variable M SD 1 2 3 4 ## 1.

The relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and disengagement coping (i.e., the a path) is expected to be moderated by gendered racial identity centrality (GRIcntlty, W). Gendered racial identity centrality is also expected to moderate the path between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health (i.e., the c path). Thus, the specified model involves the evaluation of a conditional indirect effect. Image of conceptual representation of the conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a and c paths Hayes (2018) textbook and training materials frequently display the conceptual (above) and statistical models (below). These help facilitate understanding. Image of statistical reprsentation of the conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a and c paths Looking at the diagram, with two consequent variables (i.e., those with arrows pointing to them) we can see two equations are needed to explain the model: \\[M = i_{M}+a_{1}X + a_{2}W + a_{3}XW + e_{M}\\] \\[Y = i_{Y}+c_{1}^{&#39;}X+ c_{2}^{&#39;}W+c_{3}^{&#39;}XW+ bM+e_{Y}\\] When we have complicated models such as these, Hayes (2018) suggests a piecewise approach to model building. Specifically, he decompose the model into its aggregate parts: a simple mediation and two simple moderation. Image of statistical reprsentation of the conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a and c paths Lets start with the the simple moderations. 8.5.1 Piecewise Assembly of the Moderated Mediation 8.5.1.1 Analysis #1: A simple moderation We are asking, \"Does GRI centrality moderate the relationship between gendered racial microaggressiona and disengagement coping? Y = disengagement coping X = gendered racial microaggressions W = GRI centrality Image of statistical representation of the simple moderation estimating DisEngmt from GRMS, moderated by GRIcntlty The formula we are estimating: \\[Y=b_{0}+b_{1}X+b_{2}W+b_{3}XW+e_{Y}\\] Lets specify this simple moderation model with base Rs lm() function. Lets use the jtools package so we get that great summ function and interactions for the awesome plot. Since we are just working to understand our moderations, we can run them with regular old ordinary least squares. library(jtools) #the summ function creates a terrific regression table library(interactions) library(ggplot2) Mod_a_path &lt;- lm(DisEngmt~GRMS*GRIcntlty, data=Lewis_df) summ(Mod_a_path, digits = 3) Observations 212 Dependent variable DisEngmt Type OLS linear regression F(3,208) 14.099 R² 0.169 Adj.

S.E. t val. p (Intercept) 1.417 0.517 2.741 0.007 GRMS 0.212 0.231 0.919 0.359 GRIcntlty -0.027 0.090 -0.299 0.765 GRMS:GRIcntlty 0.006 0.039 0.144 0.886 Standard errors: OLS Looking at these results we can see that the predictors account for about 17% of variance in disengagement coping. However, there is no significance in the predictors. Neither the IV variable (GRMS, [X]), nor the moderator (GRIcntlty, [Y])), nor its interaction (GRMS:GRIcntlty, [XW]) are significant. Its always helpful to graph the relationship. The interaction_plot() function from the package, interactions can make helpful illustrations. In the case of interactions/moderations, I like to run them both ways to see which makes more sense. interact_plot(Mod_a_path, pred = GRMS, modx = GRIcntlty) interact_plot(Mod_a_path, pred = GRIcntlty, modx = GRMS) The figure with GRIcntrlty as the moderator, shows a very similar prediction of disengagement coping from gendered racial microaggressions. The figure that uses GRMS as the moderator, visually, looks like there are big differences as a function of GRMS. Looking at the Y axis (disengagement), though, shows that the scaling variables are not well-spaced. Next, lets probe the interaction with simple slopes. Probing the interaction is a common follow-up. With these additional inferential tests we can see where in the distribution of the moderator, X has an effect on Y that is different from zero (and where it does not). There are two common approaches. The Johnson-Neyman is a floodlight approach and provides an indication of the places in the distribution of W (moderator) that X has an effect on Y that is different than zero. The pick-a-point is sometimes called the analysis of simple slopes or a spotlight approach, probes the distribution at specific values (often the M +/- 1SD). sim_slopes(Mod_a_path, pred = GRMS, modx = GRIcntlty) ## JOHNSON-NEYMAN INTERVAL ## ## When GRIcntlty is INSIDE the interval [3.02, 9.11], the slope of GRMS is p ## &lt; .05. ## ## Note: The range of observed values of GRIcntlty is [2.72, 9.56] ## ## SIMPLE SLOPES ANALYSIS ## ## Slope of GRMS when GRIcntlty = 4.68 (- 1 SD): ## ## Est.

We see the same result in the pick-a-point approach where at the GRIcntlty values of 4.68, 5.71, and 6.74, X has a statistically significant effect on Y. Is this a contradiction to the non-significant interaction effect? No. The test of interaction is an interaction about the relationship between W and Xs effect on Y. Just showing that X is significantly related to Y for a specific value does not address any dependence upon the moderator (W). Hayes (2018) covers this well in his Chapter 14, in the section Reporting a Moderation Analysis. What have we learned in this simple moderation? While there are no significant predictors (neither X, W, nor XW), the model accounts for about 17% of variance in the DV. Although there was a non-significant effect of GRMS on disengagement coping, analysis of simple slopes suggested a significant relationship between these variables at a given ranges of GRIcntlty. Well keep these in mind. 8.5.1.2 Analysis #2: Another simple moderation We are asking, Does gendered racial identity centrality moderate the relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health?

Looking at these results we can see that there is no significance in the predictors. Neither the IV (GRMS, [X]), nor the moderator (GRIcntlty, [Y])), nor its interaction (GRMS:GRIcntlty, [XW]) are significant. Lets look at the plots. interact_plot(Mod_c_path, pred = GRMS, modx = GRIcntlty) interact_plot(Mod_c_path, pred = GRIcntlty, modx = GRMS) The figure with GRIcntrlty as the moderator, shows fanning out when mental health is high and GRMS is low. Next, lets probe the interaction with simple slopes. Probing the interaction is a common follow-up. With these additional inferential tests we can see where in the distribution of the moderator, X has an effect on Y that is different from zero (and where it does not). There are two common approaches. The Johnson-Neyman is a floodlight approach and provides an indication of the places in the distribution of W (moderator) that X has an effect on Y that is different than zero. The pick-a-point is sometimes called the analysis of simple slopes or a spotlight approach, probes the distribution at specific values (often the M +/- 1SD). sim_slopes(Mod_c_path, pred = GRMS, modx = GRIcntlty) ## JOHNSON-NEYMAN INTERVAL ## ## When GRIcntlty is INSIDE the interval [2.97, 7.46], the slope of GRMS is p ## &lt; .05. ## ## Note: The range of observed values of GRIcntlty is [2.72, 9.56] ## ## SIMPLE SLOPES ANALYSIS ## ## Slope of GRMS when GRIcntlty = 4.68 (- 1 SD): ## ## Est.

We see the same result in the pick-a-point approach where at the GRIcntlty values of 4.68, 5.71, and 6.74, X has a statistically significant effect on Y. Is this a contradiction to the non-significant interaction effect? Again. No. The test of interaction is an interaction about the relationship between W and Xs effect on Y. Just showing that X is significantly related to Y for a specific value does not address any dependence upon the moderator (W). Hayes (2018) covers this well in his Chapter 14, in the section Reporting a Moderation Analysis. What have we learned in this simple moderation? As predictors to the DV, disengagement coping, the IV (X), moderator (W), and its interaction term (XW) have non-significant effects. That said, the overall model was significant and accounted for 11% of variance in the DV. Although there was a non-significant effect of GRMS on mental health, analysis of simple slopes suggested a significant relationship between these variables at a given range of GRIcntlty. Well keep these in mind. 8.5.1.3 Analysis #3: A simple mediation We are asking, Does disengagement coping mediate the relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health? Y = mental health X = gendered racial microaggressions M = GRI centrality Looking at the diagram, with two consequent variables (i.e., those with arrows pointing to them) we can see two equations are needed to explain the model: \\[M = i_{M}+aX + e_{M}\\] \\[Y = i_{Y}+c&#39;X+ bM+e_{Y}\\] To conduct this analysis, I am using the guidelines in the chapter on simple mediation.

The direct effect (GRMS &gt; MntlHlth when DisEngmt is in the model) falls out of significance. The indirect effect is statistically significant. The model accounts for 30% of the variance in mental health (DV) and 17% of the variance in disengagement coping (M). Recall how the bootstrapped, bias-corrected confidence intervals can be different? Its always good to check.

Image of statistical reprsentation of the conditional process analysis model where the moderator is hypothesized to change the a and c paths Looking at the diagram, with two consequent variables (i.e., those with arrows pointing to them) we can see two equations are needed to explain the model: \\[M = i_{M}+a_{1}X + a_{2}W + a_{3}XW + e_{M}\\] \\[Y = i_{Y}+c_{1}^{&#39;}X+ c_{2}^{&#39;}W+c_{3}^{&#39;}XW+ bM+e_{Y}\\] Y = MntlHlth X = GRMS W = DisEngmt M = GRIcntlty 8.6.1 Specification in lavaan In the code below First specify the equations, hints the a,b,c, labels are affixed with the *(asterisk) interaction terms are identifed with the colon Create code for the intercepts (Y and M) with the form: VarName ~ VarName.mean*1 Create code for the mean and variance of all moderators (W, Z, etc.); these will be used in simple slopes. Means use the form: VarName ~ VarName.mean*1 Variances use the form: VarName ~~VarName.var*VarName Calculate the index of moderated mediation: quantifies the relationship between the moderator and the indirect effect. To the degree that the value of the IMM is different from zero and the associated inferential test is statistically significant (bootstrapped confidence intervals are preferred; more powerful), we can conclude that the indirect effect is moderated. The IMM is used in the formula to calculate the conditional indirect effects. Hayes argues that a statistically significant IMM suggest they are (boom, done, p. 430). Create code to calculate indirect effects conditional on (M +/- 1SD) moderator with the general form: product of the indirect effect (a*b) PLUS the product of the IMM and the moderated value Because our direct path is moderated, we will use a similar process to specify the direct effects conditional on (M +/- 1SD) moderator with the general form: the direct effect (c_p1) PLUS the moderated value (c_p3) at each of the three levels (M +/- 1SD) Although they dont tend to be reported, you can create total effects conditional on the (M +/- 1SD).

IV(X) = gendered racial microaggressions; M = disengagement coping; W; gendered racial identity centrality; Y = mental health. The significance of the indirect and direct effects were calculated with bias-corrected confidence intervals (.95) bootstrap analysis. 17.78% of the variance in disengagement coping (mediator) and 31.16% of the variance in mental health (DV) are predicted by their respective models. The model we tested suggested that both the indirect and direct effects should be moderated. Hayes provides a more detailed and elaborate explanation of this on pp. 447 - 458. 8.6.4.1 Conditional Indirect effects An indirect effect can be moderated if either the a or b path (or both) is(are) moderated. If at least one of the indirect paths is part of a moderation, then the whole indirect (axb) path would be moderated. In this model, we specified a moderation of the a path. We know if the a path is moderated if the moderation term is statistically significant. In our case, \\(a_{3}\\) GRMS:GRIcntlty was not statistically significant (\\(B\\) = 0.006, \\(p\\) = 0.862). We also look at the Index of Moderated Mediation. The IMM is the product of the moderated path (in this case, the value of \\(a_{3}\\)) and b. If this index is 0, then the slope of the line for the indirect effect is flat. The bootstrap confidence interval associated with this test is the way to determine whether/not this slope is statistically significant from zero. In our case, IMM = -0.020, CI095 = -0.264 to 0.188. This suggests that we do not have a moderated mediation. Hayes claims the IMM saves us from formally comparing (think contrasts pairs of conditional indirect effects) We can even get more information about the potentially moderated indirect effect by probing the conditional indirect effect. Because an indirect effect is not normally distributed, Hayes discourages using a Johnson-Neyman approach and suggests that we use the pick-a-point. He usually selects the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles of the distribution. However, many researchers commonly report the mean+/-1SD. at 1SD below the mean \\(B\\) = -0.850, CI95 -1.267 to -0.462; at the mean \\(B\\) = -0.870, CI95 -1.236 to -0.594). at 1SD above the mean, the conditional indirect effect was significant (\\(B\\) = -0.891, CI95 -1.299 to -0.565). Looking at the relative consistency of the \\(B\\) weights and the consistently significant \\(p\\) values, we see that there was an indirect effect throughout the varying levels of the moderator, gendered racial identity centrality. Thus, it makes sense that this was not a moderated mediation. 8.6.4.2 Conditional Direct effect The direct effect of X to Y estimates how differences in X relate to differences in Y holding constant the proposed mediator(s). We know the direct effect is moderated if the interaction term (c_p3)is statistically significant. In our case, it was not (B = 0.164, p = 0.483). Probing a conditional direct effect is straightforwardwe typically use the same points as we did in the probing of the conditional indirect effect. For both my values (mean and +/- 1SD) and Hayes values (16th, 50th, 84th percentiles), the direct effect (e.g., the effect of skepticism on willingness to donate) was not statistically significant from zero at any level of the moderator. 8.6.5 Model trimming Hayes terms it pruning, but suggests that when there is no moderation of an effect, the researcher may want to delete that interaction term. In our case, neither the direct nor indirect effect was moderated (although the +1SD was close (\\(B\\) = -0.307, \\(p\\) = 0.331). Deleting these paths one at a time is typical practice because the small boost of power with each deleted path may turn on significance elsewhere. If I were to engage in model trimming, I would start with the indirect effect to see if the direct effect became moderated. This is consistent with the simple moderation we ran earlier where we saw a fanning out at one end of the distribution. 8.6.6 APA Style Write-up Note: Make sure to look at the write-up in the Lewis et al. (J. A. Lewis et al., 2017) manuscript. I am a little confused in that Figure 2 of their manuscript suggests there was a moderation of both the a and c paths. However, the results in Table 4 do not provide information about the moderation to the c path. The Lewis et al. write-up is an efficient one, simultaneously presenting the results of two outcome variables  mental and physical health. While our B weights from our simulated data map similarly onto those reported in the Lewis et al. manuscript, we do not get get the statistically significant moderated mediation that they get. Results Preliminary Analyses Missing data anlaysis and managing missing data Bivariate correlations, means, SDs Distributional characteristics, assumptions, etc. Address limitations and concerns Primary Analyses Our analysis evaluated a moderation mediation model predicting mental health (Y/MntlHlth) from gendered racial microaggressions (X/GRMS) mediated by disengagement coping (M/DisEngmt). Gendered racial identity centrality (W/GRIcntrlty) was our moderating variable. We specified a moderation of path a (X/GRMS to M/DisEngmt) and the direct path, c (X/GRMS to Y/MntlHlth). Data were analyzed with maximum likelihood estimation in the R package lavaan (v. 0.6-7); the significance of effects were tested with 1000 bootstrap confidence intervals. Results of the full model are presented in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1 (a variation of the semPlot or Hayes style representation). The formula for the mediator and dependent variable are expressed below. \\[\\hat{M} = 1.417 + 0.212X + (-0.027) W + 0.006XW\\] \\[\\hat{Y} = 31.703 + (-1.4115)X + (-0.556)W + 0.164XW + (-3.567)M\\] Results suggested a strong and negative total effect of gendered racial microaggressions on mental health that is mediated through disengagement coping. That is, in the presence of gendered racial microaggressions, participants increased disengagement coping which, in turn, had negative effects on mental health. The index of moderated mediation was -0.020 (CI95 -0.264 to 0.188) and suggested that the indirect effects were not conditional on the values of the moderator. While there was no evidence of moderation on the indirect or direct paths, there was a statistically significant, and consistently strong, mediation throughout the range of the gendered racial identity centrality (moderator). **Because we did not have a moderated mediation, I would probably not include the rest of this paragraph (nor include the moderation figure). I just wanted to demonstrate how to talk about findings if they were significant (although I acnowledg throughat that these are non-significant).* Figure 2 illustrates the conditional effects (non-significant) of GRMS (X) on mental health (Y) among those at the traditional levels of mean and +/- 1 SD where there is a fanning out of the effect of GRMS on when the presence of gendered racial microaggressions is low and mental health is at its highest. In this combination, mental health is even more positive in the presence of positive gendered racial identity centrality. Our model accounted for 17.78% of the variance in the mediator (disengagement coping) and 31.16% of the variance in the dependent variable (mental health). Figure 2. The non-significant moderating effect of gendered racial identity centrality on the relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health 8.7 Residual and Related Questions ..that you might have; or at least I had, but if had answered them earlier it would have disrupt the flow. Would you stop here? Or keep tinkering? I am tempted (but out of time, at least today, so stay tuned) to delete moderation of the indirect effect to see if I can get a moderated direct effect. My choice would also depend on to what I committed in any kind of pre-registration. My approach to science tends to be model generating (Joreskog, 1993) and in his text, Hayes (2018) advised authors to write about what they found  not all the things they tried. This tinkering remains strongly in the vein of theoretically driven analyses. The output we get is different from the output in the journal article being used as the research vignette. Why? And should we worry about it? We are simulating data. This gives us some advantages in that (unless we specify it), we never have missingness and our variables should be normally distributed. Because we are working from means, standard deviations, and correlations, our data will never be the same as the original researcher. That said, we can compare our results to the journal to check out work. I am somewhat reassured that our \\(B\\) weights align and somewhat concerned that the index of moderated moderation was so far off. I suppose I will always doubt myself, and will therefore be open to anyone who finds an error in the specification of the model. Some of the statistics you are reporting are different than the ones in Hayes and the ones that use the PROCESS macro (e.g., what happened to the F test)? The default estimator for lavaan is maximum likelihood (ML) and Hayes uses ordinary least squares (OLS). This affects both the values of coefficients, standard errors, AND the type of statistics that are reported. You can ask for OLS regression by adding the statement estimator =GLS\". Even with this option, I have not discovered a way to obtain the F tests for the overall model. Researchers seem to be comfortable with this, even asking for less than we did (e.g., many do not request R square). Best I can tell, researchers who do want this might use a combination of packages, using GLS estimators in lavaan (this easily gets them the bootstrapped CIs) and the move to a different regression package to get the intercepts and F tests. If I did this I would triple check to make sure that all the output really lined up. Why did we ignore the traditional fit statistics associated with structural equation modeling (e.g., CFI, RMSEA). I hesitate to do this with models that do not include latent variables. Therefore, we asked for an in-between amount of info that should be sufficient for publication submission (any editor may have their own preferences and ask for more). What if I have missing data? When we enter the lavaan world we do get options other than multiple imputation. In todays example we used the sem fitting function. Unless otherwise specified, listwise deletion (deleting the entire case when one of its variables is used to estimate the model) is the default in lavaan. If data are MCAR or MAR, you can add the argument missing = ml (or its alias missing = fiml). More here https://users.ugent.be/~yrosseel/lavaan/lavaan2.pdf on the 1.7/Missing data in lavaan slide. That said, the type of estimator matters. If you estimate your data with GLS (generalized least squares) or WLS (weighted least squares), you are required to have complete data (however you got it). We used maximum likelihood and, even though we had non-missing data, I used the missing = fiml code. 8.8 Practice Problems The three problems described below were designed to grow during the series of chapters on simple and complex mediation, complex moderation, and conditional process analysis (i.e,. this chapter). I have recommended that you select a dataset that includes at least four variables. If you are new to this topic, you may wish to select variables that are all continuously scaled. The IV and moderator (next chapters) could be categorical (if they are dichotomous, please use 0/1 coding; if they have more than one category it is best if they are ordered). You will likely encounter challenges that were not covered in this chapter. Search for and try out solutions, knowing that there are multiple paths through the analysis. The suggested practice problem for this chapter is to conduct a simple mediation. There are a number of variables in the dataset. Swap out one or more variables in the model of simple mediation and compare your solution to the one in the chapter. Conduct a simple mediation with data to which you have access. This could include data you simulate on your own or from a published article. 8.8.1 Problem #1: Rework the research vignette as demonstrated, but change the random seed If this topic feels a bit overwhelming, simply change the random seed in the data simulation, then rework the problem. This should provide minor changes to the data (maybe in the second or third decimal point), but the results will likely be very similar. Assignment Component 1.
